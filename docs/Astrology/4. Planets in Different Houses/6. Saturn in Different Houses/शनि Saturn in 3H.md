* **3rd = Parākram (courage/effort).** In this house, a “pāpa graha” is considered **benefic**.
* **Siblings:** Saturn here can bring **dukh** via the **younger sibling**—either strained relations or the sibling being “taken away,” creating a lifelong *“kaash chhota bhai/behen hota”* feeling.

  * If Saturn is **swarāshi/uchcha** → **good siblings**.
  * If **malefically influenced** → **bad sibling relations**.
  * Text says Saturn **generally gives more sisters** (Shani called *strī* or *napuṁsak* by scholars).
* **Aspects/Effects on mind:** From the 3rd, Saturn **looks at the 5th**.

  * **Well-placed Saturn** → **gaharāī in chitta (mind/intellect)**.
  * **Bad Saturn** → **inferiority complex** (contrast: **Mars gives superiority complex**).
* **Personal traits/results:** Person will be **intelligent**, **dānī (generous)**, will have **married-life comfort**, **but sorrow will also be there** due to Saturn’s influence.
* **Longevity angle:** 3rd is **ashtam-se-ashtam** (8th from the 8th). Saturn here **increases the 8th**, hence **āyu-kārak** in the 3rd (supports longevity).
* **Spiritual/astrology link:**

  * A **good Saturn’s drishti to the 9th** makes one **spiritual**.
  * For becoming a **good astrologer**, Saturn should be in the **3rd or 9th**, or there should be a **Saturn connection somewhere**. #profession #astrologer
  * Rationale given: **Astrologer = “doctor of time,”** and **Time = Saturn**.
