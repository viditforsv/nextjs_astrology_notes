# Karakas (Significators)

Karakas are the significators or natural significators in Vedic astrology. They can be understood from two perspectives:

1. **Rashi-based Karakas**: Each Rashi (zodiac sign) has Primary and Secondary Karakas
2. **Planet-based Karakatva**: Each planet is a natural significator for specific aspects of life
