### ⚠️ When Malefic or Afflicted

- If the 11th lord is **malefic** or afflicted, the same house of gain turns into **a source of inner struggle**.
    
- Each malefic planet shows a distinct distortion:
    
    - **Saturn in 11th:** Brings immense wealth but also stinginess — makes one super-rich yet miserly.
        
    - **Mars in 11th:** Brings wealth and authority but also anger and aggression.
        
- Malefics placed here can **manifest negativity internally**, even if external success exists.

### 🔄 Punishment Principle

- The 11th house is called the **sixth from the sixth**, meaning the **place of “punishment” (_ripu sthāna_)**.
    
- Hence, life’s hidden tests or karmic retributions **appear through the 11th house**.
    
- Even a planet in its own sign here may **show traces of the suffering it conquered** — inner tension, guilt, or restlessness alongside success.
