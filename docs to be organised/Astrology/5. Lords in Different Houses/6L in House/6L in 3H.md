## 🕉️ **1️⃣ Core Principle**

> “छठे स्थान का लॉर्ड तीसरे स्थान में — संघर्ष से ही सिद्धि।”

The **6th house** represents:

- Enemies, conflicts, diseases, debts, and service.
    

The **3rd house** represents:

- Courage, effort, writing, siblings, communication, initiative, and physical strength.
    

So when the _lord of conflicts_ sits in the _house of courage_,  
👉 **the person’s strength is born from struggle**.  
They win through persistence, not comfort.

## ⚔️ **2️⃣ Classical Logic**

- **Rishi Parashara’s principle**:
    
    > “Lagnesh ko chhathe-aathve-dwadas ka dosh nahi lagta.”  
    > Meaning — if the Lagnesh is also the 6th lord (like Venus for Taurus ascendant), it doesn’t harm unless afflicted.
    
- If **benefic and well placed** → defeats enemies, gains fame through struggle.
    
- If **afflicted or malefic** → invites self-created enemies, lifestyle diseases, stress, or quarrelsome nature.
