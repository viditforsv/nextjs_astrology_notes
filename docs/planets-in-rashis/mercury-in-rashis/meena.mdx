## Key Factors

### Debilitation (Neecha)
- <span className="hindi">बुध</span> is **debilitated in <span className="hindi">मीन</span>**
- Mercury's logical nature weakest here
- Logic drowns in emotional/spiritual waters
- Creates:
  - Confused thinking
  - Difficulty with practical matters
  - Intuitive over logical
  - Imaginative but impractical
- **However**: Digbala in 1H can help significantly
- **Neecha Bhanga**: 7L in 1H (own house) can cancel debilitation

### Digbala (Directional Strength)

### Enemy Relationship
