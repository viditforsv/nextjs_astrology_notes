    - **Lawyers**
        
    - **Veterinary doctors**

### ⚔️ Struggle & Karma

- The 11th lord here is **eighth from its own house** (6th is 8th from 11th) → shows **transformative and painful gain**.
    
- Gains come **after defeating enemies** or **overcoming challenges**.
    
- The path of success is **long, tiring, and full of obstacles** — a **painful process**, but it eventually leads to victory.

### 🩺 Health & Addictions

- Because the 6th is the **house of disease**, this placement can **spoil health**.
    
- Desires (11th) placed here often push the native into **self-destructive habits**.
    
- It may cause **addictions**, unhealthy **food habits**, or **mental restlessness**.
    
- The person may **indulge in activities harmful to their own health**, especially digestive issues (stomach problems).

### 🧠 Impact on Mind & Behavior

- Since **desires move into conflict**, the person may **invite trouble by their own actions**.
    
- The **11th lord’s placement in 6th** can cause the mind to **seek satisfaction in conflict** — fighting, arguing, competing unnecessarily.
    
- The placement can also pull the mind toward **self-harmful pleasures** like addiction, laziness, or overindulgence.

### 🧩 Afflictions & Fifth-House Connection

- If the **5th house** (intellect, decision-making) also gets **malefic influence**, it worsens the addiction tendency.
    
- A **malefic Saturn’s aspect** on the 5th can specifically create **addiction or mental fixation**.
    
- The result: the person knowingly does what is wrong or unhealthy — **buddhi bhrasht** (corruption of intellect).
