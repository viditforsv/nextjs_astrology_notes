# 7th Lord in 11th House

## 🔹 Concept Summary
- Both **7th** and **11th houses** belong to the **Kama Trikona** — the triangle of *desires and fulfillment*.  
- When the **7th Lord** moves into the **11th House**, **all material and marital desires get fulfilled**.  
- This is a **very strong placement for wealth and gain through spouse or partnerships**.  
- The native may **marry into a wealthy family** or gain substantial benefits through marriage.  
- For women, it may show *sudden rise in social or financial status* after marriage — e.g., “small house to mansion” scenario.  
- Since 11th is also the **house of gains and social network**, it can indicate **multiple marriages or relationships** — legally or otherwise.  
- **Desires increase**, because both houses amplify *Kama* energy — physical, emotional, and material satisfaction.  
- The 11th house is **5th from the 7th**, meaning love and romance continue even after marriage; it can also indicate *love before and after marriage*.  
- A **benefic planet** in the 11th (like Jupiter, Moon, or Venus) strengthens marriage and makes the spouse wise, loyal, and prosperous.  
- A **malefic** planet here, however, can indicate *secret relationships or extramarital involvements*.
