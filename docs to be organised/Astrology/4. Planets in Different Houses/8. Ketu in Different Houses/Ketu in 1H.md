1. **Basic Nature of Ketu**

   * Headless planet → lacks clarity, direction.
   * Represents **mistakes, illusions, and hidden influences**.
   * Wherever it sits, person is prone to errors and confusion.

2. **Effect in Lagna (Self, Intelligence, Presence of Mind)**

   * Presence of mind weak, decision-making poor.
   * Native keeps swinging between past and future, unable to stay in present.
   * Creates meaningless thoughts, unnecessary activities, distraction.
   * Person may become ungrateful, back-biting, or antisocial.

3. **Mental & Health Issues**

   * Since Lagna also represents intelligence, Ketu here causes:

     * Confusion, changing decisions repeatedly.
     * Mental sickness, sleep issues, head/brain-related problems.
   * If conjunct with Lagnesh → risk of insanity.

4. **Ego & Personality**

   * Causes inferiority or superiority complex.
   * Ketu = hidden, deceptive → native may cheat or appear misleading if afflicted.
   * Creates ego, pride, false self-image.

5. **Karmic Nature & Spiritual Side**

   * Ketu is “already dead” (*mukti karaka*).
   * Brings **disinterest, detachment (vairagya)** toward self-life.
   * Can give high intuition or spiritual awakening, especially with Jupiter’s influence.
   * With Jupiter → becomes highly spiritual, liberation-oriented.
   * With malefics (Mars, Saturn) → dangerous, can create unseen obstacles (*pishach badha*).

6. **Remedies & Practices**

   * Ketu in Lagna = weak head/intellect → balance through worship of **Lord Ganesha (Vinayak)**, who has the biggest head.
   * Namaskar practice: bow to the planet in Lagna with its mantra
	   * (e.g., Ketu → “Om Ganeshaya Namah”, 
		   * Om Vinayakay namah
		   * On Gan Ganpateya namah
	   * Jupiter → “Om Guruve Namah”, Om Namah Shivaay
	   * Sun - Om Suryaye namah
	   * Mars → “Om Rudraya Namah”, etc.).
	   * Mercury - Om vishnave namah
	   * Saturn - > Om Kaliye namah
	   * Rahu - Om Durgaye Namah
	   * Venus - Om maha lakshmaye namah
	   * Mars - Om Shandaye Namah , Om Rudraye namah, om hanumantaye namah
   * Rishi Parashara: bowing to deity of Lagna planet removes countless doshas.
