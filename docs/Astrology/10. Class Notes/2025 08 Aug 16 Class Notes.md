# Shad bal
- kisi graha main kitna bal hai
- 6 types of strengths a planet have
	- calculations are available in software

1 rupa = 60 Virupa
60 is very strong
0 is very less
this is a unit of time. 
### 🔹 The Six Components of Shadbala

Each planet’s strength is calculated from six categories (*ṣaṭ = six, bala = strength*).

1. **Sthāna Bala (Positional Strength)**

   * Based on the planet’s position in the zodiac.
   * Factors: exaltation/debilitation, sign placement, divisional charts (Varga), directional strength, etc.
   * Example: A planet in exaltation has maximum *sthāna bala*, in debilitation has minimum.

2. **Dig Bala (Directional Strength)**

   * Each planet is strong in a particular direction.
   * Example: Jupiter & Mercury strongest in the east (1st house), Saturn in the 7th house, Mars in the 10th, Moon & Venus in the 4th.
   * If placed accordingly, they gain full dig bala.

3. **Kāla Bala (Temporal Strength)**

   * Time-related strength.
   * Depends on: day/night, weekday lordship, planetary war, waxing/waning moon, yearly/monthly/horary cycles.
   * Example: Sun is strong in daytime, Moon at night.

4. **Cheshta Bala (Motional Strength)**

   * Related to planetary motion, especially retrogression.
   * Retrograde planets gain high *cheshta bala*, since they appear brighter and closer.
   * Direct planets have moderate strength; debilitated motion is weakest.

5. **Naisargika Bala (Natural Strength)**

   * Fixed, natural strength of planets regardless of chart.
   * Based on their apparent size and brilliance.
   * Order (strongest → weakest): Sun, Moon, Venus, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, Saturn.

6. **Drik Bala (Aspectual Strength)**

   * Strength from benefic/malefic aspects received.
   * Benefic aspects (from Jupiter, Venus, Mercury, waxing Moon) increase bala, while malefic aspects (Saturn, Mars, waning Moon, Sun, nodes) reduce it.
