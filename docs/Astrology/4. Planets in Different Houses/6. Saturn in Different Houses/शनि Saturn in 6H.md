* **Enemies & litigation**

  * Creates enemies **and** destroys them—good for **court cases**.
  * Style of defeat: with Saturn in 6th, **enemies weaken over time** (Saturn = time).


* **Health & body**

  * **Lower abdomen / lower body** gets some **malefic influence**.

* **Aspects & what they do (per text)**

  * From 6th, Saturn aspects **8th, 12th, 3rd**.
  * Being **8th-house karaka**, its aspect **reduces 8th-related effects**; increases “malefic influence,” **reduces malefic influence on sādhana**, and **boosts sādhana** (text is internally mixed, but stated as such).
  * **12th**: Saturn is also a **karaka of the 12th**, so it can **balance expenses** and **can take the native abroad**.
  * **3rd**: **Increases parākram** (effort/courage) because 3rd is **tamas**; Saturn’s glance **boosts it**.

* **Marriage & relatives**

  * **Bad for marriage**: Saturn sits **12th from the 7th**, creating **pāpa-kartari** effect on the 7th.
  * **Maternal uncle (māmā) side**: **Bad relationship**; indicates **pending karma/debt** toward māmā’s family—“you must keep doing for them, and you won’t get anything back.”
  * Also mentions **suffering with chāchā/māmā** since 6th is their domain.

* **Animals & possessions**

  * 6th is also **animals’ house**; Saturn denotes **buffalo** → tendency to **keep such animals**.

* **Enemy archetype / lifelong focus**

  * Can produce a **long, multi-year feud** (25–50 years), even a focus on **finishing a clan/person**; alternatively, an **inner disease** can be the “enemy.”

* **Core life “homework” (as stated)**

  * 6th = **ripu sthān**; with Saturn here, the **ripu (enemy)** given is **greed**.
  * Saturn gives **abhāv** (lack) → **inferiority** → **greed**.
  * **Biggest challenge**: **reduce greed**. The moment greed appears, you’re in **Saturn’s trap**, and **Saturn’s blow** will land.
