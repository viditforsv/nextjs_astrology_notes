# Fundamentals of Vedic Astrology

## Core Concepts

Vedic Astrology is built on several fundamental principles that form the foundation of chart interpretation.

### Sidereal vs Tropical Zodiac

- **Vedic (Sidereal)**: Based on fixed star positions, accounting for the precession of equinoxes
- **Western (Tropical)**: Based on seasonal positions relative to the Sun
- **Ayanamsa**: The difference between the two systems (currently ~24 degrees)

### The Birth Chart (Janma Kundali)

The birth chart is a snapshot of the sky at the exact moment and location of birth. It consists of:

1. **Lagna (Ascendant)**: The rising sign at birth
2. **12 Houses**: Different areas of life
3. **Planets**: Positioned in signs and houses
4. **Nakshatras**: Lunar mansions occupied by planets

### Five Elements (Pancha Mahabhuta)

- **Fire (Agni)**: Aries, Leo, Sagittarius
- **Earth (Prithvi)**: Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn
- **Air (Vayu)**: Gemini, Libra, Aquarius
- **Water (Jala)**: Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces
- **Ether (Akasha)**: Present in all

### Three Gunas (Qualities)

- **Cardinal (Chara)**: Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn - Initiating
- **Fixed (Sthira)**: Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius - Sustaining
- **Mutable (Dwi-svabhava)**: Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces - Changing

## Chart Calculation

Vedic charts are traditionally drawn in two formats:
- **North Indian**: Diamond-shaped chart
- **South Indian**: Square chart with fixed house positions

Understanding these fundamentals is essential before diving deeper into planetary analysis and predictions.
