## Jupiter in 10th House (Dasham Sthana)

### General Significance

* 10th house = all karma, not only profession; also *Rajya Sthana* (seat of power, authority).
* Jupiter here:

  * Gives **money, fame, power**.
  * Native becomes a **consultant, ministerial advisor (Amatya)**, mentor, coach.
  * Association with bureaucrats, politicians, high-profile people.

### Financial Orientation

* **5th aspect on 2nd house**:

  * Wealth through intellect, advisory roles, finance, banking, mutual funds, financial products.
  * Inclination toward consultancy, software consultancy, advisory-based income.
* Jupiter = finance & banking → often brings gains without large capital investment.

### Special Combinations

* If connected with 9th house (exchange between 9th & 10th lords):

  * **Dharma-Karma Adhipati Yoga** → immense rise, especially in spiritual/astrology-related business.
* Jupiter + Mercury exchange:

  * Balances wisdom (*vivek*) and intellect (*buddhi*).

### Staan Hani Principle

* Causes some loss in karma:

  * Over-intellectualization can lead to missing opportunities.
  * If afflicted, native may talk knowledge but fail to implement it; excessive advising without execution.
* Afflicted Jupiter here can ruin career by misusing intellect.

### Professional Style

* Works best in advisory/consultancy roles rather than operational execution.
* Needs strong Mars and Saturn for successful execution of projects.
* Examples: astrologers, chartered accountants, doctors, self-employed professionals who solve others’ problems.

### Key Insight

* Jupiter’s knowledge is meant for others, not self.
* Cannot easily solve own issues, but highly effective for solving others’ problems.
