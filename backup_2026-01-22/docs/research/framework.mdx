# SPEIM Framework

The SPEIM framework is our thinking framework for comprehensive analysis across five dimensions of human experience and development. It provides a structured approach to understanding individual behavior, decision-making, and personal growth as well as for group of individuals and mass level thanks to this exploration using [PYS (Patanjali Yoga Sutras)](/wiki/yoga-sutras). 

## The Five Dimensions

### S - आध्यात्मिक (Spiritual)
The realm of consciousness, higher purpose, and connection to the divine or universal truth.

### P - शारीरिक (Physical)
The material body, health, vitality, and physical well-being.

### E - भावनात्मक (Emotional)
The realm of feelings, relationships, and emotional intelligence.

### I - बौद्धिक (Intellectual)
The realm of knowledge, wisdom, learning, and mental faculties.

### M - भौतिक (Material)
The realm of possessions, resources, wealth, and material security.

## The Journey of Discovery

It all started here. I have been following this framework for almost a decade now, and it has evolved tremendously over these years. My first inspiration came from the book ["The One Thing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_One_Thing_(book)).

I immediately felt that this book did not capture so many other dimensions of my being. So I continued searching and expanded this model to SPEIM.

Even then, over the years, SPEIM failed to capture many aspects of life. As a student of meditation and astrology, I continued this quest for years. The answer was in front of me all along - **[PYS, Patanjali Yoga Sutras](/wiki/yoga-sutras)**. On one fine day in September 2024, it just clicked. God, Guru, or Shiva himself blessed me with the knowledge of this subtle connection, which led to this research.

## The Sacred Connection

**5 pillars of SPEIM** ↔ **[5 Niyamas and 5 Yamas](/research/yamas-niyamas)**
- **5 Pandavas** in Mahabharata
- **5 Tattvas** (elements)
- **5 senses** (पंचिंदियाँ)

This was a profound moment for me - realizing that the ancient wisdom of [Maharishi Patanjali](/wiki/maharishi-patanjali) had already mapped the complete framework for human development across all dimensions.

## Personal Exploration and Limitations

When I realized the connection, I started exploring it immediately. I discovered that my predictions were astounding and my understanding deepened significantly. But why was it such a revealing experience?

I was able to apply SPEIM effectively for personal use cases only. I could apply this framework to individual situations very well. For example, when making a business decision, I can analyze it through the lens of SPEIM and reach a clear outcome.

When exploring who would be the right partner for me and what qualities I was looking for, I applied the SPEIM framework and it worked brilliantly.

When analyzing a couple to determine their compatibility, I think through the SPEIM framework and it works like a charm. But...

It fails miserably when I apply it to social issues or situations involving more than one individual, such as understanding how a person would behave or feel towards their immediate family and society. [Vedic Astrology](/wiki/hora-shastra) answers this beautifully, but the SPEIM framework fails here. As a result, I had to incorporate another framework for thinking. This felt absurd initially because SPEIM was able to capture almost everything initially - because, to be honest, we all start selfish...

After my realisation with [PYS](/wiki/yoga-sutras), [YAMAS and NIYAMAs](/research/yamas-niyamas), I was able to expand this SPEIM framework to personal as well as social events. And this began this research. I hope astrology students learn something from it. 

I feel immensely grateful to [Maharishi Patanjali](/wiki/maharishi-patanjali) and [Maharishi Parasara](/wiki/maharishi-parasara), I hope I can do justice to their vast knowledge and help spread this knowledge to better the world. I hope my teachers and mentors keep guiding my way and I make them proud.
