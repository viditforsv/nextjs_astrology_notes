- 1. **Basic Nature**

   * 4th house = home, mother, happiness, inner peace, direction of the soul.
   * Ketu here creates **restlessness**: the person cannot sit at home, always running around.
   * Soul becomes **directionless**, life feels unsettled.

2. **Impact on Happiness & Home**

   * Causes detachment (*vairagya*) from home, mother, and domestic comforts.
   * Creates constant involvement in disturbances, entanglements.
   * If afflicted → relationship with mother suffers.
   * If in benefic sign (esp. Jupiter’s sign) → can turn toward spirituality, astrology, inner awakening.

3. **Emotional Nature**

   * Such people are **neither fully happy nor fully sad** (“na saawan hare, na bhaado sukhe”).
   * Experiences both comfort and suffering, but remains detached.
   * Can become emotionally flat (*neeras*). Even wealth or pleasures fail to excite them.

4. **Effect on Lifestyle**

   * Keeps person unsettled at home, constantly active or entangled in affairs.
   * Women with Ketu in 4th often feel unable to manage home or keep it stable.
   * Tendency for instability in residence, property, or domestic peace.

5. **Rahu–Ketu Axis (4/10)**

   * 4th Ketu ↔ 10th Rahu = life pulled between spirituality (Ketu) and material ambition (Rahu).
   * Creates contradiction: day may be ambitious/material, night inclined to spirituality (or vice versa).
   * People may appear very religious to some, very worldly to others.

6. **Direction & Guidance**

   * 4th house planet is like the **charioteer** of life’s vehicle. With Ketu there, direction becomes unclear.
   * Remedy: Worship of **Goddess Dhumavati or Chamunda** for guidance and stability.
   * Until proper spiritual anchor is found, life keeps swinging between yoga (detachment) and bhoga (indulgence).
