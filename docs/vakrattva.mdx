# Vakrattva (Retrograde Motion)

Vakrattva refers to the retrograde motion of planets, where planets appear to move backward in the zodiac.

---

## Overview

When planets are in retrograde motion (vakrattva), they gain special strength and behave differently than in direct motion.

**Note:** This simulation demonstrates the apparent retrograde movement of planets from Earth's perspective, using both heliocentric and geocentric models.

## Key Characteristics

- **Cheshta Bala**: Strong desire and inner drive
- **Karmic Backlog**: Pending karma from past lives
- **Delayed Results**: Outcomes come later but are stronger
- **Unusual Behavior**: Planets act in unexpected ways

## Planets and Retrograde

- **Sun & Moon**: Never retrograde
- **Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn**: Can be retrograde
- **Rahu & Ketu**: Always retrograde

## Effects

- Retrograde planets have increased influence
- Results are delayed but more significant
- Indicates karmic lessons to be completed
- Creates introspection and deep analysis
