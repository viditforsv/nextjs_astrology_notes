* **3rd lord in the 6th house**:

  * Very good for **athletics, sports, competitive activities, tendering work, and contests**.
  * Because 3H = effort, courage, communication; 6H = competition, struggle, enemies.

* **Communication side:**

  * Since 3L (communication lord) goes into conflict (6H), the native can **create enemies through speech/writing**.
  * They must be very careful while writing emails, talking on phone, or in communication.

* **Siblings:**

  * Younger brother (3H) goes into 6H (house of enemies).
  * This can make **younger brother an enemy**, or create conflict with him.

* **Wealth/material pleasures:**

  * 3L in 6H can also make the person **wealthy**.
  * Why? Because the native gets the **power to win through effort and struggle**.

* **Planetary energies:**

  * 3rd house always has energies of **Mars (courage/action)** and **Mercury (intellect/communication)**.
  * Both have good roles in 6H:

    * **Mars in 6H** → wins through fighting/strength.
    * **Mercury in 6H** (Virgo, exalted) → wins through intelligence, excellent for business and profession.
  * Hence Mercury in 6H is considered very good: gives yield, prosperity, and wealth.

* **Maternal uncle/aunt aspect:**

  * Some texts say native will have **enmity with maternal uncle** (mama), but love for maternal aunt (mami).
  * Reason: 3H lord when in 6H creates conflict from maternal uncle’s side, but gives affection towards maternal aunt.

* **Health/profession:**

  * 6H is also the house of stomach/digestion (Virgo sign, earth element, yield).
  * Mercury in 6H is linked with harvest, productivity, and good business outcomes.

---

✅ **In short:**

* **3rd lord in 6th house** is very good for sports, competition, business, and wealth through struggle.
* But it can create **conflicts via communication** and problems with younger brother.
* If Mercury is involved, it gives excellent business skills and prosperity.
* If Mars is involved, it gives victory through courage and fights.
