# 8H Remedies


### 🔮 **Remedies for Malefic Planets in 8th House (अष्टम भाव):**

#### 1. **Mantras (Based on Planet in 8th House)**

Recite or listen if you cannot chant – especially **Ashtakshari (8-syllable) mantras**:

| Planet in 8th House | Recommended Mantra                       |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Mars (Mangal)**   | *Chamunda Mantra* or *Rudrashtakam*      |
| **Rahu**            | *Om Namo Narayanaya*                     |
| **Shani (Saturn)**  | *Rudrashtakam*, *Kal Bhairav Ashtakam*   |
| **Jupiter (Guru)**  | *Om Namah Shivaya* (optional, if needed) |
| **Ketu**            | *Ganpati Mantra*                         |

> ❗Note: These mantras should ideally be practiced with **guru’s guidance** or after **diksha**, but can also be *heard regularly* for effect.

#### 2. **Ashtakams (अष्टकम – 8-verse stotras)**

Great as remedial chants and very effective:

* **Rudrashtakam**
* **Kal Bhairavashtakam**
* **Durga Ashtakam**
* **Lingashtakam**
* **Hanumat Ashtak** (for Hanuman)

> These are aligned with the number **8** (Ashtam Bhav), and are spiritually charged for overcoming suffering and karmic baggage.

---

#### 3. **Pranayama (प्राणायाम)**

* Described as **the most powerful remedy** for planets in the 8th house.
* Balances pranic energy → reduces fear, anxiety, and karmic replays.
* Long-term practice *"pre-pays the karmic loan"* and uplifts the mind and spirit.

---

#### 4. **Sadhana (Spiritual Practice)**

* Regular **spiritual sadhana** helps clear past karmas and blocks.
* Especially crucial for people undergoing **intense Saturn, Rahu, or Ketu influence** in the 8th.

---

#### 5. **Serve Your Karma** (Through Awareness and Action)

* Accept the suffering as part of karmic repayment.
* Instead of resisting, engage in **voluntary austerity** (fasting, seva, meditation).

---

#### 6. **Faith & Bhakti (भक्ति)**

* Deep **devotion (bhakti)** to deity or guru can act as karmic purifier.
* *“Bhakt ko bhagwan bolte hain kood ja, kood jaata hai”* – a devotee surrenders fearlessly, and that surrender purifies deeply.

---

#### 7. **Avoid Misuse of 8th House Powers**

* Identify if your 8th house is giving you occult, astrological, or healing abilities.
* Use them ethically. Misuse intensifies karmic backlash.
