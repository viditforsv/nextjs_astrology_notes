# Conjunctions

Planetary conjunctions occur when two or more planets are placed in the same house or sign.

---

## Overview

When planets are conjunct (in the same house), they influence each other and combine their energies. The effects depend on:

- Nature of the planets (benefic/malefic)
- Strength of the planets
- House where conjunction occurs
- Lordship of the planets

## Key Principles

- Conjunctions modify the expression of both planets
- Stronger planet tends to dominate
- Benefic planets can purify malefic planets when conjunct
- House significations are affected by the combined energy
