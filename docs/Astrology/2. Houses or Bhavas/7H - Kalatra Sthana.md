### 🪷 **7th House (Saptam Bhava)** — *Partnership, Position, Pleasure*

| Aspect                  | Insights                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**                | *Kalatra Sthana* — Partnering place; “Kalatra” also means *conflict* where bliss exists within friction.                                  |
| **Domain**              | Spouse, relationships, physical union, marriage, self-employment, consulting, diplomacy, and **public-facing roles**.                     |
| **Element**             | **Air** (Libra) — Ruled by Venus.                                                                                                         |
| **Body part**           | Genital region (above the reproductive organs).                                                                                           |
| **Business vs Job**     | 6H = *Job*, 7H = *Business* (consulting, freelancing, self-employed roles).                                                               |
| **Kendra (Pillar)**     | 7th is one of the four cardinal pillars of life (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th).                                                                    |
| **Opposition Role**     | 7th is 180° from Lagna — signifies “The Other”. Hence, opposites attract.                                                                 |
| **Psychological angle** | Reveals *your mindset* toward marriage and partnerships — not what your partner is, but how you perceive and act in the relationship.     |
| **Shadow**              | If marriage breaks, 7H becomes a *Maraka (death-inflicting)* house — “when a relationship dies, it feels like personal death.”            |
| **Extended meanings**   | Public visibility, sexual abuse, child abuse (negative extremes), approach toward physical pleasure.                                      |
| **Advanced roles**      | In Prashna Kundali (Horary), 7H signifies **missing/lost people or objects** — the farthest from Lagna (Self).                            |
| **Divine Energies**     | One of Brahma’s “Dhi-Shakti” centers: 1. बुद्धि (Intellect), 2. शुद्धि (Purity - 4H), 3. वृद्धि (Growth - 7H), 4. सिद्धि (Success - 10H). |
