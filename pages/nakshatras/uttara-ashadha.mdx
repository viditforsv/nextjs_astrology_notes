## Special Notes

Uttara Ashadha is excellent for:
- Starting long-term projects
- Marriages and commitments
- Foundation laying ceremonies
- Making important decisions
- Legal matters
- Setting up institutions

This is considered one of the most auspicious nakshatras because it bridges Sagittarius (philosophy) and Capricorn (practical achievement), combining idealism with realism.

**Special Significance**: 
- Lord Rama was born in Uttara Ashadha, exemplifying dharma and righteous victory
- The nakshatra gives "Apradhrisya Shakti" - the power of permanent victory that cannot be taken away

The elephant tusk represents strength that endures. Unlike Purva Ashadha's invincibility through force, Uttara Ashadha's victory comes through adherence to universal principles and dharma.

People born under this nakshatra often achieve lasting success later in life after patient, ethical effort. They leave permanent legacies.
