## 🔹 Concept Summary
- The 7th Lord moving to the 3rd House means **spouse goes to the 9th from 7th** → the spouse becomes *fortunate*, but for the native, the placement brings **struggle or conflict**.
- The native’s **marriage partner may prosper**, but **the native faces challenges or disputes** due to this.
- If afflicted, it can indicate **conflict with siblings**, **issues in communication**, and even **marital infidelity (adultery)** in extreme cases.
- Represents **courage, communication, effort**, and **sibling relationships** — marriage themes mix with these areas.
- Every 3rd-house matter must be “earned through struggle”; nothing comes easily here.
- The 7th house itself is a *house of war and desire*, so its lord in 3H amplifies *conflict in relationships* and *effortful marriage*.

## 🧭 Notes
- **Core Dynamic:** “My spouse prospers, but I must struggle.” The marriage is karmically effortful.  
- **Afflicted Cases:** If Venus (karaka for marriage) or 7L is severely afflicted, it may lead to *adultery with sibling’s spouse* or moral conflict.  
- **Foreign Connection:** Since 7H represents foreign elements and 3H movement implies “away,” siblings or spouse may live abroad.  
- **Conflict Factor:** The 3rd being a *house of battle and courage* ensures that relationship success requires active effort and compromise.
