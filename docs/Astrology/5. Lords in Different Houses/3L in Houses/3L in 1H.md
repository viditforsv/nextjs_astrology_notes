* If the **3rd lord is in the 1st house (ascendant)**, the native becomes **self-made**, builds **self-made wealth**, and has courage, effort, and struggle power.
* Such a person is disposed to serve, courageous, and intelligent—but often **devoid of formal learning**.
* Why? Because the **3rd house is “yuddh sthana” (house of struggle/war)**. Its karaka (significator) is **Mars**, while its natural lord is **Mercury**.
* Mars acts without thinking, while learning comes from study. Thus, intelligence here comes more from effort than from structured education.
* The 3rd lord Mercury in ascendant makes one intelligent, but Mars as significator brings action, less dependence on learning.
* Mercury and Mars are opposite in nature:

  * **Mars** always wants to fight and win.
  * **Mercury** (linked to Vishnu) prefers peace, diplomacy, never wants to fight.
* Examples from mythology:

  * Krishna asked only for 5 villages to avoid war, but was forced into war.
  * Rama tried to avoid fighting Ravana.
  * Vishnu’s incarnations generally did not want conflict.
* Thus, Mars vs Mercury = **fighter vs diplomat**.

  * Mars uses **hands (action)**.
  * Mercury uses **brain (diplomacy)**.
* A king needs both: a fighter and a diplomat, hence both can be friendly but often have different opinions.
* Example:

  * **Narendra Modi**: very strong exalted Mars, war and action dominated.
  * **Manmohan Singh**: strong Mercury, economist, peaceful, diplomatic.
* These two energies are usually not both dominant in one person. Rarely you find someone with both strong Mars and Mercury.
* Hence, when it’s said the person is “devoid of learning,” it means **not inclined to formal study** (classroom, rote, exams).
* Instead, the person is good at **implementation and practical work** because they carry both Mars’ power and Mercury’s adaptability.
* Mercury has **digbala (directional strength) in ascendant**, and Mars is **swarashi dev (self-sign lord)** here—together they create strong talent.
* This is an excellent combination for **actors, musicians, dancers, writers**, since the 3rd house governs **communication, writing, and creativity**.
* Mercury gives **acting, comedy, role-changing ability** (the talent to transform into different roles).
* Venus gives the **entry into performance/artistic world**, but **Mercury gives the performance skill itself**.
