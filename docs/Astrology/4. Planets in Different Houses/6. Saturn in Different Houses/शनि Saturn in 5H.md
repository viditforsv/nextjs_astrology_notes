- Inferiority complex and greed.
- * **Children:**

  * Saturn generally **delays children**.
  * If Saturn is **malefic** and the **5th lord is weak/troubled**, it can **deny children**.
  * If Saturn is **good here**, it gives **more female children**.

* **Intellect & personality (buddhi/chiṭṭa):**

  * **Late starter**, but once it switches on, it’s **deep**—Saturn as a **philosopher/deep thinker**.
  * Makes the native **stubborn/obsessive (सनकी)**; “what’s set is set.”
  * Because of this mindset, **insult/embarrassment** happens.
  * If **malefically influenced**, it **fills negativity** in the mind; person can become **“evil-minded.”**

* **Guru & mantra:**

  * 5th is mantra/guru—**Saturn delays meeting the Guru**.

* **Pūrvapuṇya & karma:**

  * 5th = **pūrvapuṇya**. Saturn here (esp. with malefic influence) surfaces **malefic karmic data** → you **pay a lot of karmas**.
  * Saturn’s job = **delay** → delays the **rise of pūrvapuṇya** and **takes away life’s easiness**.
  * Net: **life becomes a struggle** with Saturn in the 5th.

* **Overall verdict in the text:**

  * **“Not a very good placement”** for Saturn because it **spoils pūrvapuṇya** and **delays**.
