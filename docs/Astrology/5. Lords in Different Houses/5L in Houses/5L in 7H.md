Here’s a complete and structured interpretation of **“5th Lord in 7th House”**, integrating your transcript with traditional _Parāśari_ and psychological-spiritual logic 👇

- _Child or love_ may bring struggle or pain.
    
- Multiple affairs or pre-marital physical relations possible if Venus/Moon/Rahu involved.
