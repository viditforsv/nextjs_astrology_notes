### 4 types of karma:  
- Kriyaman - the action in the moment of action
	Future is defined by Kriyaman
- What will happen in Future is agami karma
	What happens when we repeatedly we do something? 
- Accumulating of karma: sanchit karma
	What we do regularly or accumulate is: sanchit karma
	Sanchit karma is what we get in next life because of sanchit karma of the past life. 
	Kundli is possible because of some karma of the past. That is because of sanchit karma
	Any talent is just being fine tuned because of our efforts. The natural talents are because of Sanchit Karma. 
	Guruji says: all talent can be groomed by purusharth.
- Prarabdh karma: Juice of Sanchit karma. I.e the nature of your being when sanchit karma happens or when you choose to behave when sanchit karma acts in your life. 
	You cannot choose your parents
	You cannot choose your age
	You cannot change what you will experience. 
	Aayu, jaati and bhog nahi badal sakte. 
	Prarabdh is accumulated sanchit over years
