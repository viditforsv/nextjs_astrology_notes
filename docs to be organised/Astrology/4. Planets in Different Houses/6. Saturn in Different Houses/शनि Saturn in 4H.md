* **Mother & “sukh” (comfort)**

  * 4th = mother. With Saturn here, **mother–child relation suffers**; whether the mother “remains” depends on **4th lord and Moon**.
  * If **Moon strong / 4th lord well placed** → mother remains **but** **maternal sukha is lacking** because Saturn dominates the 4th.
  * If **Moon is weak/afflicted** → Saturn can **“take the mother”** / give **full damage** to the 4th.
  * If **Saturn is lagna lord and well placed** → **mother becomes long-lived (āyu-kārak)**.

* **Mind & mood**

  * 4th = **mind**. Saturn in the 4th **plants sorrow permanently** → the native is **generally unhappy**.
  * Placement is called **“generally not good”** for Saturn; child may be **sickly early on**, improves **slowly**.

* **Home / property / vehicles**

  * Saturn = **old/history** → **older home** tendency.
  * Likes **second-hand / vintage / heritage cars** (4th = conveyances; Saturn = second-hand).
  * If **well placed** (and as **karaka for land**) → **immense property/wealth** from land.

* **If Moon is afflicted (examples given)**

  * **Major sorrow from mother**: being **ignored** among siblings, **denied money**, **thrown out**, or **treated like a step-child** throughout life.
