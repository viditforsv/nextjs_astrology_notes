# Dashas (Planetary Periods)

Dashas are planetary periods that are crucial for timing events in Vedic Astrology. They show when specific karmas will manifest.

## Vimshottari Dasha System

The most commonly used dasha system, with a total cycle of 120 years.

### Dasha Periods

| Planet | Years | Represents |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Ketu | 7 | Spirituality, detachment, past karma |
| Venus | 20 | Relationships, wealth, pleasure |
| Sun | 6 | Authority, father, government |
| Moon | 10 | Mind, mother, emotions |
| Mars | 7 | Energy, property, siblings |
| Rahu | 18 | Desires, obsessions, foreign |
| Jupiter | 16 | Wisdom, children, fortune |
| Saturn | 19 | Discipline, delays, hard work |
| Mercury | 17 | Business, communication, skills |

**Total**: 120 years

### Calculation
- Starting point determined by Moon's nakshatra at birth
- Proportional balance of nakshatra ruler's dasha at birth
- Then follows natural sequence

### Subdivisions

1. **Maha Dasha**: Main period (as shown above)
2. **Antar Dasha**: Sub-period within Maha Dasha
3. **Pratyantar Dasha**: Sub-sub-period
4. **Sookshma Dasha**: Micro-period
5. **Prana Dasha**: Finest division

### Example Structure
If in Venus Maha Dasha (20 years):
- Venus-Venus: 3 years, 4 months
- Venus-Sun: 1 year
- Venus-Moon: 1 year, 8 months
- Venus-Mars: 1 year, 2 months
- Venus-Rahu: 3 years
- Venus-Jupiter: 2 years, 8 months
- Venus-Saturn: 3 years, 2 months
- Venus-Mercury: 2 years, 10 months
- Venus-Ketu: 1 year, 2 months

## Interpretation Principles

### Results Based On:

1. **Planet's Nature**
   - Natural benefic/malefic
   - Functional benefic/malefic for ascendant

2. **House Rulership**
   - Which houses the dasha planet rules
   - Better results if rules good houses (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11)

3. **Placement**
   - Sign (exalted/debilitated/own/friend/enemy)
   - House (Kendra/Trikona/Dusthana)
   - Conjunction and aspects

4. **Strength**
   - Shadbala (six-fold strength)
   - Dig Bala (directional strength)
   - Ashtakavarga points

### Antar Dasha Effects
The sub-period ruler modifies the main period:
- Friendly antar lord: Smooth period
- Enemy antar lord: Challenges
- Own antar dasha: Pure results of that planet

### Transit Importance
Dashas + Transits = Actual manifestation
- Dasha shows what karma is ripe
- Transit shows when it manifests

## Practical Example

**Saturn Maha Dasha** (19 years):

**For Taurus Ascendant** (Saturn rules 9th & 10th):
- Generally favorable
- Career growth, father's support
- Saturn-Jupiter antar: Especially good (Jupiter rules 8th & 11th)
- Saturn-Mars antar: Some challenges (Mars rules 7th & 12th)

**For Leo Ascendant** (Saturn rules 6th & 7th):
- More challenging
- Health issues, relationship struggles
- Need to focus on discipline and service

## Tips for Dasha Analysis

1. **Check Multiple Charts**: Birth chart + Divisional charts
2. **Consider Transits**: Especially Saturn and Jupiter
3. **Past Patterns**: Review past dashas for patterns
4. **Remedies**: Strengthen weak dasha planets
5. **Free Will**: Dashas show tendencies, not absolute fate

### Remedies During Difficult Dashas
- Mantras specific to planet
- Gemstones (after proper consultation)
- Charity on planet's day
- Fasting
- Meditation and spiritual practices
- Strengthen chart through good karma

Remember: Dashas reveal timing, but free will and effort determine the ultimate outcome.
