# Dasha Interpretation Framework

When analyzing a planetary Dasha period, consider the following seven key factors about the Dasha lord (the planet whose period is running):

## 1. House Placement (जिस घर में बैठा है)
**Which house the Dasha lord occupies**

The house position of the Dasha lord indicates the primary life area that will be activated during its period.

- 1st house: Self, personality, health
- 2nd house: Wealth, family, speech
- 3rd house: Courage, siblings, efforts
- 4th house: Mother, property, emotional peace
- 5th house: Children, intelligence, creativity
- 6th house: Obstacles, enemies, health issues
- 7th house: Partnerships, marriage, business
- 8th house: Transformation, longevity, occult
- 9th house: Fortune, dharma, higher learning
- 10th house: Career, status, father
- 11th house: Gains, friendships, aspirations
- 12th house: Losses, spirituality, foreign lands

## 2. Conjunctions (जिस के साथ बैठा है)
**Which planets the Dasha lord sits with**

Planets conjoined with the Dasha lord will significantly influence the results of the period. Their nature (benefic/malefic), strength, and lordships all matter.

## 3. House Lordship (जिस घर का मालिक है)
**Which house(s) the Dasha lord rules**

The Dasha lord rules certain house(s) in the chart. Events related to those houses will manifest during its Dasha.

## 4. Aspects Given (जिन स्थानों को देखता है)
**Which houses and planets the Dasha lord aspects**

The houses and planets aspected by the Dasha lord will also get activated and produce results during the Dasha period.

## 5. Aspects Received (जिन ग्रहों के द्वारा देखा जाता है)
**Which planets aspect the Dasha lord**

Planets aspecting the Dasha lord modify its results - benefic aspects enhance, malefic aspects create challenges.

## 6. Nakshatra Placement (जिस ग्रह के नक्षत्र में बैठा है)
**Which nakshatra the Dasha lord occupies**

The nakshatra lord becomes a sub-dispositor, adding another layer of interpretation. The nature and placement of the nakshatra lord influences the Dasha results.

## 7. Nakshatra Dispositor Chain (जिसके नक्षत्रों के घर में बैठा है, वो मालिक जिस का मालिक है)
**The nakshatra lord's own placement and lordships**

Follow the dispositor chain:
- Dasha lord → in nakshatra of Planet A
- Planet A → occupies house X, rules house Y
- This creates a complex web of influences

## Application

All seven factors must be synthesized to accurately predict the Dasha period results. No single factor works in isolation.

### Example Analysis Process

For Sun Mahadasha:
1. Sun is in which house? (e.g., 10th house - career focus)
2. Which planets conjoin Sun? (e.g., Mercury - communication in career)
3. Which houses does Sun rule? (e.g., 5th house - creativity brings career success)
4. Which houses does Sun aspect? (e.g., 4th house - property through career)
5. Which planets aspect Sun? (e.g., Saturn aspect - delays/discipline in career)
6. Sun is in whose nakshatra? (e.g., Ashwini - Ketu's nakshatra)
7. Where is Ketu placed and what does it rule? (Follow the chain)

## Integration with Sub-Periods

The same framework applies to:
- **Antardashas** (sub-periods)
- **Pratyantardashas** (sub-sub-periods)

The results are a combination of both the Mahadasha lord and Antardasha lord influences.
