# Retrograde & Combustion

Comprehensive guide to understanding Vakri (Retrograde) and Asta (Combust) planets in Vedic Astrology.

## Retrograde Planets (Vakri Graha)

### What Is Retrograde?

- **Apparent backward motion** of a planet as seen from Earth
- Happens when planet comes closest to Earth and farthest from Sun
- **Appears** to move backward due to relative speed and position
- Common analogy: Train moving forward while platform appears to move backward

### Astronomical Context

- All planets orbit Sun at different speeds
- When planet is ~6th, 7th, 8th (up to ~9th) from Sun → appears retrograde
- Retrograde begins ~130° to 220° from Sun

Key effects:

## Combustion (Asta Graha)

### What is Combustion?

- Planet comes **too close to Sun**
- Sun burns the planet, making it **weak + agitated**
- Planet loses visibility (symbolically and literally)
- **Karakatva (significations) fade**

### Combustion Range

| Planet | Combustion Range |
|--------|------------------|
| Moon | ± 12° |
| Mercury | ± 12° or ± 14° (if retrograde) |
| Venus | ± 10° or ± 8° (if retrograde) |
| Jupiter | ± 11° |
| Mars | ± 17° |
| Saturn | ± 15° |

**Planets within ± 1° are totally burnt** - karakatva completely obstructed

### No Borders in Sky
- Combustion starts when planet enters range **regardless of Rashi boundary**
- Planets can be combust even in different Rashis but within degree range
- More degree difference = less combustion effect

## Two Meanings of Combustion

1. **Sun takes over planet's responsibility**
   - If 7th lord combust → Sun handles spouse matters
   - If 5th lord combust → Sun handles child karma

2. **Sun suppresses planet's independence**
   - Planet under Sun's control
   - Acting on behalf of combust lord's domain
   - Like being close to king - loses own voice/autonomy

## Effects of Combustion

### Physical vs Psychological

**Asta graha does NOT take intellectual capabilities**, only **physical capabilities**:
- **Mercury combust**: Speech affected, but intelligence remains
- **Venus combust**: Relationship issues, but creativity may continue

### General Effects
- Planet's talents fade
- Person feels disconnected from those areas
- Planet becomes **kshubhit (disturbed)**
- Leads to anger, irritation, frustration
- **Anxiety, anger, restlessness**
- Like being on hot tawa - agitated

### Relationship to Planets
- Jo planet ast hai, usse related relation ki tabyat kharab rahegi (Related person's health suffers)
- Venus combust: Wife's/spouse's health issues
- Mars combust: Brother's problems
- Moon combust: Mother's challenges

## Degree Analysis - Behind vs Ahead

### Planet Behind Sun (Approaching)
- Planet at 18°, Sun at 20°
- **Planet approaching Sun**
- **Burn experienced in THIS life**
- Tapasya in current incarnation

### Planet Ahead of Sun (Leaving)
- Planet at 24°, Sun at 18°
- **Planet already passed combustion**
- Burn experienced in **PAST life**
- Native carries residue, feels relaxed in comparison
- Shows up as deficiency or hesitation

### Example Chart Analysis
**Sun at 18.35°:**
- **Moon at 15.25°**: Behind Sun → approaching combustion → tapasya this life (especially 3H = siblings)
- **Saturn at 8°**: Far from Sun → will combust later in life → career/karma issues later
- **Mercury at 20.34°**: Ahead of Sun → combust in past life → hesitation, speech blocks

## Combustion by Planet

### Moon Combust
- **Amavasya** (New Moon)
- NOT technically combust, but **extremely weak**
- No "Manas" (mind) energy
- Emotionally blank state
- Internalized, hidden emotional world

### Mercury Combust
- Frequent combustion due to closeness to Sun
- Logic and speech may be impaired
- Silent intellect, protected mind, speaks less

### Venus Combust
- Gets combust often
- Affects relationships and artistic abilities
- Beauty suppressed by societal norms

### Mars Combust
- **Less damaging** due to inherent fiery nature
- However, courage and initiative may reduce

### Jupiter Combust

- Blessings weakened but wisdom remains

### Saturn Combust
- **Worst combustion**
- Extreme karmic friction
- Emotions severely suppressed
- Maximum struggle

## Retrograde + Combust Combined

### Dual State Paradox
- Protected yet rebellious
- Silent yet calculating
- Suppressed outwardly, deeply active inwardly

### Mercury & Venus (Unique Planets)
- Never go more than 1-2 Rashis from Sun
- **Can be Retrograde + Combust simultaneously**

**Such people are:**
- Highly intelligent
- Reserved and calculative
- Often misjudged but very cultured
- Combust Mercury: Silent intellect, speaks less
- Combust Venus: Restricted sensuality, deep cultural discipline

### Effects by Combination

**Retrograde + Combust**:
- High internal energy
- Suppressed expression
- Karmic weight
- Sun gives shelter but burns independence
- Person looks subdued but highly aware
- Deeply involved in responsibilities and spiritual refinement

## Dasha Effects

### Asta Graha During Dasha
- Causes **Tapasya** (heat, struggle) in planet's areas
- Example: Guru (Jupiter) combust and 11th lord → income blocked during Jupiter Dasha
- If 7L combust → tapasya in marriage
- If 11L combust → work harder to earn money

### Vakri Graha During Dasha
- Intensified results
- Karmic completion phase
- May bring unexpected outcomes
- Vakri graha aayu deta hai (Retrograde planets add years to life)
  - Used in age calculations

## Ast Graha Drishti

### Combust Benefic
- Blessings from presence and drishti are weak and diluted
- Lachari (helplessness) in giving benefits

### Combust Malefic
- Aristha (harm) in aspect
- More aggressive
- **Exception**: Mars less affected by combustion

### Best Combustion: Jupiter
- Even combust Jupiter remains somewhat benevolent

### Worst Combustion: Saturn
- Creates maximum struggle and suppression

## Special Planet States

### Ast + Vakri Together
- **Very strong planet**
- Protected and empowered
- High internal energy
- Disciplined expression

### Examples by Relationship

**Saturn Combust + Sun**:
- Sun at same house, same degree
- Intense karmic friction
- Emotions completely suppressed

## Remedies

### For Retrograde Planets
- **Acceptance and patience**
- Complete pending karma consciously
- Don't rush, allow natural timing
- Introspection and self-reflection
- Seek proper guidance
- Strengthen planet through worship and discipline

### For Combust Planets
- Strengthen Sun (helps manage combustion)
- Accept Sun's authority in that area
- Practice tapasya consciously
- Don't fight the process
- Surrender ego
- Let Sun handle responsibilities

### General Wisdom
- Combustion is not just malefic; it's **tapas and refinement**
- Retrogression is not weakness; it's **deep desire to rise**
- Both demand **patience, awareness, and correction**
- Each retrograde planet = **karmic echo from past life** wanting to finish business

## Practical Takeaways

**Vakri (Retrograde)**:
- Karmic push to complete pending work
- Strong but delayed karma activation
- Brings: Delay + Desire (Cheshta Bala) + Frustration
- Push toward introspection and mastery
- Results in 2nd or 3rd phase of life

**Asta (Combust)**:
- Loss of power due to being too close to ego/Sun
- Physical effects suppressed, psychological may remain
- Tapasya in planet's domain
- Sun takes over responsibilities

**Always judge using:**
- House ownership
- Degrees (behind or ahead of Sun)
- House placement
- Combination of factors
