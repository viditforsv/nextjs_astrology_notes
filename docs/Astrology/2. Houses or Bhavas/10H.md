## **House 10 – Dasham Bhava (House of Karma, Profession)**

* **Essence**: Not just job/profession — reflects all karma.
* **Represents**: Status, recognition, career, rise in life, public respect.
* **Key Theme**: *“Siddhi through Karma”* – consistent effort leads to mastery.
* **Planet**: Ruled by **Saturn** in the natural zodiac (Capricorn).
* **Traits**: Discipline, hard work, structure.
* **People Represented**: Boss, senior figures, father-like authorities (not necessarily biological father).
* **Comparison with 6th House**:

  * 6th = job/nature of service.
  * 10th = growth in career/status.
* **Karma & Life Span**:

  * 8th House = life span.
  * 10th House = karma.
  * If karma is unfinished, one cannot leave the Earth.
* **Free Will**: Highest in the 10th house. You choose your karma.
* **Respect**: Comes from what you do. Even a thief gets respect among thieves if he excels.
* **Siddhi (mastery)**: Comes only after repetitive practice.
* **Example**: Even slicing a tomato well needs practice; mastery earns reverence like Tendulkar in cricket.
