# Research - Original Framework Development

This section contains original research connecting Vedic Astrology with Yoga philosophy and modern psychological frameworks.

## The SPEIM Framework

The **SPEIM Framework** is a comprehensive system for understanding human experience across five dimensions:
- **S** - Spiritual (आध्यात्मिक)
- **P** - Physical (शारीरिक)  
- **E** - Emotional (भावनात्मक)
- **I** - Intellectual (बौद्धिक)
- **M** - Material (भौतिक)

### Research Topics

#### Core Framework
- **[SPEIM Framework](/research/framework)** - The foundational five-dimensional model for human development

#### Sacred Connections
- **[Yamas and Niyamas](/research/yamas-niyamas)** - The ethical foundations from Patanjali's Yoga Sutras
- **[SPEIM-Yamas-Niyamas Connection](/research/speim-yamas-niyamas-connection)** - The profound integration of ancient wisdom with modern framework

#### Practical Applications
- **[Sun in Different Houses](/research/sun-in-different-houses)** - Applying SPEIM framework to planetary placements

## The Journey

This research began with the SPEIM framework, developed over a decade for personal growth analysis. The breakthrough came in September 2024 with the realization that **Patanjali's Yamas and Niyamas** perfectly map to the five SPEIM dimensions.

This connection revealed that the ancient wisdom had already captured the complete framework for human development across all aspects of life - individual and social, material and spiritual.
