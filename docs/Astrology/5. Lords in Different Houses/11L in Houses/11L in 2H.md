**(00:02)**

- **11th lord in the 2nd house** forms a **Dhana Yoga (wealth combination)**.
    
- Because when the **lord of gains (11th)** sits in the **house of accumulated wealth and family (2nd)**, it **makes the native wealthy**.
    
- It also **fulfills desires** through one’s **money and family**.
    
- Such a person can also be **very charitable**, since from the 2nd house the planet aspects the **8th house (house of renunciation and samādhi)**.

- Why? Because a company is like a **large family** that you feed and sustain — the 11th–2nd link symbolizes this cycle of earning and sharing.
