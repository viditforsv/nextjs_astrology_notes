### **11th Lord in 3rd House – Transcript Notes (Chronological)**

---

**(00:02)**

- The **11th house** represents **desires (ichha)** — it is part of the **Kāma Trikona** (houses of desire: 3rd, 7th, and 11th).
    
- So when the **11th lord** moves into the **3rd house**, the placement is considered **reasonably good** because it connects **desire (11H)** with **effort (3H)** — forming a **Kāma connection**.
    
- **Interpretation:**
    
    - The native becomes **skillful in all kinds of work**.
        
    - Gains wealth and **father’s blessings**.
        
    - However, there can sometimes be **pains or struggles**, because the 11th is the **6th from the 6th** and **8th from the 8th**, showing inherited struggle and transformation.

- The speaker emphasizes that these results aren’t limited — one must **analyze the 11th lord’s relation from every house** to get a full picture.
    
- For example:
    
    - When **malefics** sit in the **4th house from the 11th**, it gives material gain but also makes one **leave their home** — since 4th is the **8th from the 11th**, it causes detachment from comfort.
        
- The principle: every placement must be read **relationally** (from both the 11th and the target house).

- When **11th lord** is in the **3rd house**, it’s often observed that the person is **either the eldest or the youngest** in their family.
    
- This comes from a **special research related to Rahu** and sibling patterns.
    
- The logic:
    
    - **Rahu–Saturn energy** in the 3rd house tends to **“kill” or suppress the 3rd house significations**, especially **same-gender siblings**.
        
    - So, for example:
        
        - A **male native** may have **younger sisters** but **no younger brothers**.
            
        - The pattern flips for female charts.

- Hence, **11th lord in 3rd house** → “either eldest or youngest” because the middle sibling structure often gets disrupted.

- **Desire (11th)** now connects to **self-effort (3rd)** — meaning:
    
    - The person **fulfills desires through their own actions and courage**.
        
    - They rise in life **through self-made effort**, not by inheritance or external support.
        
- This combination links **Kāma Trikona houses (3–7–11)** and also **Dharma Trikona indirectly (9–5)** — symbolizing **growth through personal initiative**.
    
- The **11th lord in 3rd house** guarantees **rise through hard work and personal willpower**.

- Comparative insight:
    
    - **11th lord in 2nd house** → wealth comes **through family support**.
        
    - **11th lord in 3rd house** → wealth comes **through one’s own skill, courage, and communication**.

- The **11th lord** also indicates **source of income**:
    
    - **2nd house** placement → income from **speech, finance, family, banking, or investments**.
        
    - **3rd house** placement → income from **communication, media, writing, telecommunication, software, marketing, teaching, or self-expression**.
        
- The principle extends further:
    
    - **11th lord in 4th house** → income from **land, real estate, vehicles, education, or public connection**.

- So the 11th lord tells **where** and **how** income manifests.
    
- Specifically for the **3rd house**, gains come from **skills, communication, media, writing, or technology**, depending on the supporting planets.
