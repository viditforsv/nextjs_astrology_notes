* The lord of the 3rd house situated in the 4th house:

  * The native will be happy, wealthy, intelligent.
  * If afflicted → he will lose lands and live in others’ property.

* Fourth house is the wealth of the third house.

  * Whatever efforts we make, we make them for happiness.
  * Any effort in life is for some pleasure or comfort.
  * Example: climbing Everest, cycling 50 km – effort is for the feeling of happiness.

* When the 3rd lord goes into the 4th house:

  * The person will be happy by his own effort.
  * The result of effort comes in the form of happiness.
  * The 4th house contains all kinds of materialistic comforts.
  * The person is intelligent.

* If afflicted:

  * Issues with the mother.
  * The 3rd is the 12th from the 4th – excess pleasure destroys effort.
  * Afflicted 3rd lord in the 4th:

    * Destroys property.
    * Destroys comforts.
    * Loss related to home (the 12th of 4th is loss of home).

* Case example:

  * Chart of a man in Belgium.
  * Exchange: 4th lord in the 3rd, 3rd lord in the 4th.
  * For three years, he has been building a house in an Indian village.
  * Spent around 12 crores, keeps building and breaking the house.
  * Family troubled – he only talks about meditating, says he is done.
  * Already spent 12–13 crores, still 3–4 crores budget left.
  * Astrologer’s conclusion: he cannot build the house.

    * Property is going into expenditure.
    * Expenditure is coming into property.
    * Whenever property is built, the exchange activates → house comes + loss comes together.

* Conclusion:

  * 4th = property/house.
  * 3rd = loss of house.
  * If there is an exchange between the two houses → house comes, loss comes, both repeatedly.
  * Therefore, when the 3rd lord is in the 4th house and afflicted, the person can be homeless.
  * That is why it is written: he will live in others’ property.


* If the **3rd lord is in the 4th house**:

  * The native will be **happy, wealthy, and intelligent**.
  * Why? Because efforts (3H) are directed towards happiness and comforts (4H).
  * All efforts are done to achieve pleasure and material comforts.
  * Example: climbing Everest or cycling 50 km → done for happiness.
  * So this placement gives happiness and wealth **through one’s own effort**.

* If the **3rd lord is afflicted in 4th house**:

  * It can cause **loss of property**.
  * It can **destroy happiness and comforts**.
  * Since 4H is also the **12th from 3H**, excessive indulgence in pleasure can destroy one’s effort (purushartha).
  * The person may end up living in **others’ property** (homelessness).

* **Case example given:**

  * A chart with **exchange between 3rd and 4th lords** (3L in 4H, 4L in 3H).
  * Person living in Belgium but repeatedly building a house in his village in India.
  * Spent ~12–13 crore, kept demolishing and rebuilding, family distressed.
  * Because of the exchange, whenever property (4H) activates, loss (3H) also activates.
  * Hence, property and its destruction run together.

---

✅ **In short:**

* **3rd lord in 4th house** → happiness, wealth, intelligence, and comfort through own efforts.
* **If benefic/strong** → success in property, vehicles, comforts.
* **If afflicted** → loss of property, wasteful expenditure on house, possible homelessness or dependence on others’ property.
* **Exchange of 3rd & 4th lords** → repeated cycles of property gain and loss, building and destruction.
