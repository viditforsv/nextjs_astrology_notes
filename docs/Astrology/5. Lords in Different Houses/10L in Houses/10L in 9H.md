## 🔹 Core Concept

1. When the **10th lord** occupies the **9th house**, the **lord of karma (profession)** moves into the **house of dharma and fortune**.
2. This creates a union of **Kendra (10th)** and **Trikona (9th)** — one of the most auspicious possible connections in a birth chart.
3. The native is **born under a royal or noble vibration** — not necessarily in a king’s family, but with the *capacity to live like one* through fortune and merit.
4. Even if born ordinary, such a person can rise high and **live equal to a king** in prosperity and dignity.

8. The person performs karmas in harmony with dharma, bringing inner and outer success.
9. Children tend to be **fortunate, beautiful, and well-placed in life**, as the 9th is the 5th from the 5th.

## 🔹 When Afflicted

18. If the 10th lord in 9th becomes **afflicted**, luck weakens:

* **Support collapses at the last moment** — “fortune betrays at the end.”
* The person may become **overly fate-dependent** or **careless with opportunity**.

19. In some cases, affliction makes the 10th lord act as a **māraka (killer) for the father**, causing difficulties or loss to the father’s health or life.
