**Summary – Sun in the 7th House (Transcript Only)**

* In the **Kalpurush chart**, the 7th house is Libra (Tula), where Sun is **debilitated**.

* Sun is **not considered good** here because:

  * 7th house relates to **married life** and is ruled by Venus, which is Sun’s enemy.
  * Creates **marital problems** – desire for comfort from spouse but not receiving it.
  * Sun tends to **separate from spouse**; even exalted Sun here can cause excessive heat in the 7th house, harming the relationship.

* **Positive aspects**:

  * 7th house is also **“Pad Prapti”** (position/recognition) → can bring political/government status.
  * Sun’s aspect on the ascendant can make the person **very intelligent** and recognized in public life.

* **Negative aspects**:

  * Can make the person **selfish**.
  * Health issues possible: **genital problems, union dysfunction, piles**.
  * **High chance of second marriage**.
  * Tendency to expect others to obey; difficult to make them understand another’s perspective.
  * Problems with **business partners** due to authority conflicts.
  * If afflicted, can lead to **low character in dealings with opposite gender**.
  * Sun-Venus combination is **especially bad for marriage**, as Sun “burns” Venus (spouse significator), potentially reducing spouse’s longevity.

* **Other points**:

  * 7th house also signifies **daily wages/self-employment**; Sun here can give popularity and authority in such domains, especially in government-related roles.
