* **Family Conflict:** Can make the person **rebellious towards their family**; conflict with lineage (“kula virodhi”).

* **Wealth Issues:**

  * They may be **extravagant**, spending recklessly “like a king.”

* **Sharp/Harsh Speech:** Harsh, cutting words that “burn” the listener; can unintentionally offend.

* **Maraka Impact:** Sun burns where it sits → **not good for spouse’s longevity** (because 2nd house is 8th from the 7th).
	* spouse ka pitta bad jaata hai

* **Eyesight Issues:** Sun in 2nd often weakens **eyesight**; may need glasses.

* **Financial Instability:** With heavy malefic influence, money doesn’t “stay” — they pay for everyone, money flows out quickly.

* **Maraka role:** Can bring challenges to spouse’s health/longevity due to its fiery nature.
* **Afflicted Sun → Wealth drains easily:** Such a person shouldn’t keep large sums of money personally; it won’t stay.
