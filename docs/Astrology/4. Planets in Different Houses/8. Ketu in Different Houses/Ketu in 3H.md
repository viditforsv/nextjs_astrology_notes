1. **Strength of Placement**

   * 3rd house = *parakram* (courage, effort, activity).
   * Malefics generally do well in 3, 6, 11 → hence **Ketu is strong here**.

2. **Adventurous Nature**

   * Person becomes **very adventurous, daring, fearless**.
   * Acts without much thought, takes sudden risks (e.g., bungee jumping without hesitation).
   * Different from Rahu (seeks praise); Ketu acts quietly, instantly, without show.

3. **Hidden Strength**

   * May appear weak in normal situations, but in adversity becomes **super strong**.
   * Gains potency, reputation, power, and even longevity (*ashtam se ashtam* effect).

4. **Effect on Siblings**

   * 3rd house = younger siblings.
   * Ketu here can cause **loss of sibling** (death, separation, detachment).
   * If no loss, then creates **distance/indifference** in relationship with younger siblings.

5. **Activity & Anxiety**

   * 3rd is a rajasic house (activity, courage).
   * Headless Ketu here increases **anxiety, restlessness, unnecessary activity**.
   * Normal life: person is anxious, restless.
   * Difficult life situations: person emerges a **winner** through courage.

6. **Ketu’s Inverse Nature**

   * Acts opposite to Rahu.
   * Rahu pulls toward *bhoga* (material indulgence), Ketu toward *yoga* (detachment, spirituality).
   * Hence, in 3rd → instead of external display, gives **inner strength and detachment**.
