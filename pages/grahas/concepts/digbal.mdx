# Digbala (Directional Strength) <span className="hindi">दिग्बल</span>

## Introduction

**Digbala** (<span className="hindi">दिग्बल</span>) is one of the six sources of planetary strength (Shad Bala) in Vedic astrology. It refers to the directional strength that planets gain when placed in specific houses based on their natural direction.

## Concept

Each planet has a natural direction where it gains maximum strength:
- Planets gain strength when placed in houses that correspond to their natural directional affinity
- This strength is independent of other factors like exaltation, debilitation, or sign lordship
- Digbala adds to the overall strength of a planet
