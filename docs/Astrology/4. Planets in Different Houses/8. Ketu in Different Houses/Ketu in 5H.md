1. **Children & Progeny**

   * Denial of pregnancy, especially in female charts.
   * Prevents conception or causes miscarriage/abortion.
   * With Mercury’s influence → multiple abortions possible.
   * With Mars’ aspect → danger/accident to child (confirmed cases in practice).
   * Indicates karmic block on *putreshna* (desire for children), since Ketu tries to detach from worldly bondage.

2. **Health & Stomach Issues**

   * 5th house = stomach → Ketu causes undiagnosable stomach disorders.
   * Person complains of stomach cramps, pain, etc., but doctors fail to detect.
   * Research shows: **first doctor always fails** to diagnose Ketu-related disease. Need second opinion.
   * With Mercury → diagnosis becomes more complicated and delayed.

3. **Duty & Blind Following**

   * 5th = intellect, *buddhi*. Ketu here blocks reasoning.
   * Person becomes blindly dutiful in whatever role is assigned.
   * E.g., as housewife/mother → sacrifices body, energy, self, to fulfill that duty without questioning.
   * No flexibility of thought, only rigid adherence to duty.

4. **Paranormal & Psychic Effects**

   * Can give paranormal or psychic experiences (seeing spirits, visions of past/future).
   * More likely when Ketu is in 5th or 8th.
   * Makes the mind prone to unusual or mystical perceptions.

5. **Karmic Indications**

   * 5th house = *Purva Punya* (past life merits). Ketu here = “Pishach Badha” (blockage from past life karmas).
   * Symbolically like the last missing block in Tetris: progress halts at a crucial moment.
   * Ego (*mad*, *abhiman*) becomes a trap. Once pride develops, Ketu “makes you dance” with suffering.

6. **Dangerous Combinations**

   * Ketu + Mars aspect in 5th = very dangerous → Pishach Badha, heavy obstacles related to children, mind, health.
   * Creates repeated setbacks and suffering until remedies/spiritual practices are done.
