## Core Interpretation Principles

### Three Functions of a Planet

1. **Lordship (स्वामित्व)** - Responsibility
   - What the planet MUST do in the chart
   - Power and authority
   - Cannot change

2. **Position (बैठक)** - Behavior/Quality
   - How the planet performs its role
   - Jahan baitha hai wo quality hai uska
   - Environment determines expression

3. **Drishti (दृष्टि)** - Desire
   - What the planet WANTS to influence
   - Temporary, time-bound
   - Activates during Dasha

### Permanence vs Temporariness
- Some things are permanent (like becoming CA, engineer)
- Some are temporary (desires through drishti)
- Drishti-related desires activate in Dasha periods

## Planetary Nature

### Core Principle
**Intrinsic nature does NOT change**
- Just as strict vegetarian won't eat meat abroad
- A planet won't suddenly act against its nature
- Even exalted malefic remains malefic in core (but produces benefic results)

### Example
- Like Lord Vishnu (benevolent even in aggressive forms)
- Mars exalted still has fire element
- But delivers constructive results

## Desire and Time

- **Human desire is time-bound**
- As you progress toward goal, many familiar desires become meaningless
- Desire naturally dissipates once object is attained
- Or when novelty wears off

## Jupiter (Guru) Special Notes

### Where Jupiter Sits
- Guru jahan baithte hain us sthan ki haani karte hain
- Growth happens but through learning and effort
- Not immediate material gain

### Where Jupiter Aspects
- Growth with steps and organized manner
- Gratitude should be present
- Put effort where Guru aspects - it will bear fruit
- Intention and attention → growth

### Jupiter vs Mercury
- Mercury = Learning, information, intellect
- Jupiter = Wisdom, transformation of knowledge
- Must move beyond intellect to attain wisdom
- Father-son relationship in mythology

## Saturn (Shani) Special Notes

### Where Saturn Sits
- Shani jahan baithte hain us sthan ki vriddhi karte hain
- Growth through **constructive mehnat (hard work)**
- Despite malefic nature, sitting creates growth

### Where Saturn Aspects
- Jahan Shani ki drishti hai, takat daalna bekar hai
- Don't waste energy where Saturn aspects
- Bring acceptance, surrender, dispassion
- Struggle is guaranteed

### Shani in Own House
- Saturn will harm his own house (exception to rule)
- Saturn has no choice
- But tries to reduce damage

### 6th House Saturn
- **Excellent Saturn**
- Shatru harta (destroys enemies)
- Good placement for this malefic

## Mars Special Notes

### Good vs Bad Mars
- Direction of Mars energy matters
- **Good**: Army, protection, discipline
- **Bad**: Terrorist, destruction
- Who is directing that Mangal matters

### Mars and Brahmacharya
- Brahmachari banata hai (Creates celibacy)
- Brahmacharya palan karne se urja bani rehti hai (Energy preserved)
- People with strong Mars are actually peaceful

### Mars Professions
- Politicians = Mars energy
- Leadership requiring assertiveness and courage

## Venus & Jupiter Relationship

### Opposition & Balance
- Jupiter = Guru of Devas (Sattva)
- Venus = Guru of Asuras (Rajas)
- Contrast necessary in life
- Guru don't like Mercury much (but are related)

### Pleasure vs Happiness
- **Venus**: Pleasure, entertainment, sensuality
- **Jupiter**: Happiness, wisdom, spiritual contentment
- Dancing at club = Venus
- Peace alone = Jupiter

## Mercury Special Notes

### Adaptability
- Jiske saath baithta hai waisa ho jaata hai
- Becomes like whoever it sits with
- Diplomat and prince
- Child-like, agile, witty

### Power in Kaliyuga
- Extremely powerful in Kaliyuga
- Age of information and money
- Money never sleeps (24x7 active)

### North Direction
- Mercury rules North
- Any city/country - North is more prosperous

### Degree Transition
- Mercury at 0.01° in any rashi = just left previous rashi
- Will give results of both rashis
- After 1° = fully settled in current rashi

## Moon Special Notes

### Speed and Change
- Fast graha - Mann 2.5 din main badal jaata hai
- Changes nakshatra every 2-3 days
- Jahan baithega wahan speed create kar dega

### Amavasya
- Moon not combust but extremely weak
- No Manas (mind) energy
- Emotionally blank state

## Sun Special Notes

- Surya kisi bhi raashi main ghuste hi result dete hain
- Gives results immediately upon entering any sign
- To understand Sun, understand Lord Ram or father figures

## Multiple Aspects

- **Negative reducing positive, positive reducing negative**
- Cancelling each other out
- Net effect depends on relative strength

## Own House Aspects

- Even malefic planet looking at own house doesn't harm much
- **Exception**: Saturn will harm own house (has no choice)
- Shubh graha aspect on its house makes it very strong

## Attention and Growth

**Core Principle:**
- Intention and attention jahan hota hai wo grow karta hai
- What gets attention grows

**Application:**
- Jahan Jupiter ki drishti: Give attention → growth and happiness
- Jahan Saturn ki drishti: Acceptance and dispassion needed

## Remedial Philosophy

### Where to Put Effort?
- **Jahan Guru ki drishti hai** - Put effort there (Takat yahan daalno)
- **Jahan Shani ki drishti hai** - Acceptance and surrender

### Understanding Desire Through Drishti
- Drishti reveals what planet wants
- Placement shows what planet has
- Balance both for complete understanding

## Important Combinations

### Ast + Vakri Together
- Very strong planet
- Protected and empowered
- High internal energy

### Uccha + Vakri
- Can lead to fall due to overconfidence
- All resources but lack of zimmedari (responsibility)

### Neech + Vakri
- No resources but reach great heights
- Uchcha-like results through hard work

### Swagrahi + Vakri
- Like uchcha (exalted)
- Very powerful placement

## First Rule of Jyotish

**Jo hai so hai** (What is, is)
- Acceptance is key to understanding Jyotish
- Cannot practice astrology without acceptance
- See reality as it is, not as we wish

## Final Wisdom

- Aatma needs to be balwaan (strong soul) to learn Jyotish
- Combine lordship, placement, and drishti for accurate reading
- Every planet has a role and purpose
- No planet is purely good or bad
- Context determines manifestation
