* **3rd lord in 12th house**:

  * Combination for **foreign stay** (along with 7L, 9L, 12L).
  * 3H = short journeys; when its lord goes to 12H (foreign/expenses), it shows **residing abroad**.
  * This is a good placement for **living in foreign countries**.

* **Hobbies and spending:**

  * 3H = hobbies, interests.
  * When its lord goes to 12H = **money spent on hobbies/pleasures**.
  * Person may also spend on **evil or wasteful needs** since 3L is generally not considered good.

* **Father and fortune through spouse:**

  * Some texts say: father may be **cruel**.
  * Native may become **fortunate through wife**.
  * Reason: 3H = wife’s fortune (9th from 7H). When it goes to 12H (comfort of fortune), it gives benefits through spouse.

* **Planet-specific notes:**

  * If Mercury (communication) goes to 12H → contracts, communication, or writing can create **losses**.
  * If Mars goes to 12H → courage/effort is wasted, leads to **loss of parākrama**.
  * Mars in Pisces (12H natural sign) is in Jupiter’s sign, watery, so gives mixed/average results.

* **Overall impact:**

  * For **general life** → an average placement, can cause loss through communication, contracts, hobbies.
  * For **foreign travel/stay** → very good. Brings opportunities to stay abroad, especially for temporary or long-term residence.

✅ **In short:**

* **Strong positive side** → Excellent for foreign travels and living abroad, fulfillment of spouse-linked fortune.
* **Negative side** → Loss of effort, wasteful expenses on hobbies/pleasures, possible troubles through communication or contracts.
