# Planet Energy in Vakrattva

Mathematical investigation of planetary energy distribution during vakrattva (retrograde motion).

## Observation

Sir mentioned that **a planet is 75% available when it is in vakrattva**. This research attempts to investigate the mathematical foundation behind this observation.

## Mathematical Analysis

### Energy Distribution Principle

**Energy as Second Degree Function**

In physics, energy is always a second degree function. For example, kinetic energy:

$$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

A planet in vakrattva equally shares its **chestha bal** between:
- Houses it sees directly
- Houses it sees by vakrattva

### Energy Calculation

**Step 1: Energy Reduction**

When a planet is in vakrattva, its energy is distributed between two directions:

$$E = \frac{1}{2}$$

The energy becomes **50%** of its original value.

**Step 2: Power Relationship**

**Baithak** (power/strength) is a linear function, parallel to momentum and force:

$$P = \sqrt{E}$$

This is analogous to how momentum relates to kinetic energy in physics.

**Step 3: Final Calculation**

Substituting E = 1/2:

$$P = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.707$$

**Result:** A planet in vakrattva operates at approximately **70.7%** power in each direction.

## Conclusion

The mathematical analysis yields **70.7%**, remarkably close to the observed **75%** availability mentioned in class.

$$\boxed{\text{Single Direction Strength} \approx 70.7\%}$$

## Implications

### Single Direction Impact

Vakrattva reduces planetary effectiveness by about 25-30% for each house:

$$\text{Reduction} = 100\% - 70.7\% = 29.3\%$$

### Total Impact on Chart

Since vakrattva affects **2 houses** simultaneously, the total effect is:

$$\text{Total Impact} = 2 \times 70.7\% = 141.4\%$$

This **41% extra impact** makes vakri planets more significant than the same planet in direct motion.

### Key Takeaways

- The reduction is mathematically quantifiable
- Energy distribution follows physical principles  
- Both direct and retrograde influences must be considered
- Vakri planets have **enhanced total influence** despite reduced individual direction strength

## Physical Principles

### Energy-Power Relationship

In physics:
- Energy ∝ v² (second degree)
- Power ∝ v (first degree)
- Therefore: P = √E

### Detailed Calculation

**Normal Placement:**
- $E_1 = 1$ (full energy, one direction)
- $P_1 = \sqrt{1} = 1$

**Vakri Placement:**
- $E_2 = 1/2$ (energy split)
- $P_2 = \sqrt{1/2} = 1/\sqrt{2} \approx 0.707$
- **Ratio:** P₂/P₁ ≈ 0.707

**Total Impact (both directions):**
- $P_{total} = 2 \times 0.707 = 1.414$
- **141% of normal impact**

## Practical Application

When analyzing a retrograde planet:

1. **Identify** both houses where the planet has influence
2. **Apply** ≈ 70.7% strength to each house individually
3. **Consider** combined effect of ≈ 141% total impact
4. **Understand** this creates unique dynamics different from direct motion

### Mathematical Summary

$$\boxed{\begin{array}{l}
\text{Per Direction} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 70.7\% \\[8pt]
\text{Total Impact} = \sqrt{2} \approx 141.4\%
\end{array}}$$
