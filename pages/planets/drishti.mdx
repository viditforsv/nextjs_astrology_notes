# Drishti (Planetary Aspects)

Understanding planetary aspects (drishti) is crucial for chart interpretation. Drishti reveals what a planet **desires** to influence in the chart.

## What is Drishti?

- **Drishti** = Desire to communicate or influence
- Planets have desire to communicate through their aspect
- Like humans who look to express something when they look
- Where a planet looks **from** determines its intent, based on its position (house)

### Contextual Intent

- Planet in kitchen will ask for kitchen help
- Planet in bedroom asks for comfort
- **Same way**: A planet's aspect is meaningful based on its **house placement**

### Examples
- Sitting in dining room and asking for water makes sense
- From bathroom, you'd ask for towel
- **A planet's drishti is contextual to where it sits**

## Three Functions of a Planet

1. **Lordship (Swami)** - Power and responsibility
   - Example: Sun in 10th house = career power
2. **Position (Baithak)** - Mood and role
   - Which house it sits in
3. **Aspect (Drishti)** - Desires and what it wants to influence
   - Time-bound desires
   - Activate during Dasha

## All Planets Have 7th Aspect

**Like eye contact** → Full intent and direct gaze

Every planet aspects the **7th house** from its position (opposite house)

## Special Aspects

### Mars (4th, 7th, 8th)

**Fire element** aspects:

**4th Aspect** - Burns happiness
- 4th house is of pleasure and happiness
- Fire instead of water now
- Desire and anger of that house
- **You want to win** that house
- Example: 4th drishti on 11H → Native wants to earn good salary

**7th Aspect** - Standard full aspect
- Direct confrontation energy

**8th Aspect** - Creates obstacles
- Kashta or obstacle (8H is of kashta)
- Fighting in that area
- Aggressive pursuit despite obstacles

**Remedy**: Pour water with intention of those houses on Shivaling

**5th Aspect (Pancham Drishti)** - Past Life Merit
- Good results of purva punya
- Creative talent increases
- Pleasant memory and intelligence
- Growth with steps and organized manner

**9th Aspect (Navam Drishti)** - Fortune & Growth

- Jupiter in 5th → 9th (5th aspect), 11th (7th aspect), 1st (9th aspect)
- Mars in 12th → 3rd (4th aspect), 6th (7th aspect), 7th (8th aspect)

**Tip**: Practice by seeing planet's house and directly counting forward

## Mutual Aspects (Two Planets Aspecting Each Other)

### General Principle
- Whoever is **stronger will win**
- **Shubh graha ki drishti se paap graha pavitra ho jaata hai** (Benefic's aspect purifies malefic)
- If they both aspect each other, malefic becomes purified

### Specific Combinations

**Jupiter + Rahu** aspect each other:
- Rahu becomes purified (pavitra)
- Rahu becomes calm (shaant)
- Rahu will try but won't be able to do much harm

**Jupiter + Sun** aspect each other:
- Wonderful combination
- Government-related auspicious yoga

**Saturn + Venus**:
- Poison in relationships
  - 3rd drishti: Struggle
  - 7th drishti: Complete loss
  - 10th drishti: Pending karma in relationships

**Jupiter + Saturn**:
- Saturn becomes positive
- Wisdom tempers karmic harshness

**Saturn + Mars**:
- Struggle on both sides
- Zehreela gussa (poisonous anger)
- Hostile Saturn
- War happening

**Guru + Shani** (Guru receiving Saturn's aspect):
- Value system becomes corrupted
- Wisdom challenged by karma

**Guru + Mangal** (Guru receiving Mars' aspect):
- Desire in knowledge
- Want to win and compete with knowledge
- Aggressive learning

**Surya + Shani** aspecting each other:
- Surya ko nuksaan hota hai (Sun gets harmed)
- Authority challenged by karma

## Drishti and Placement

Drishti tells us **what the planet wants** in our lives:
- **Placement** = What the planet knows/is ("I know this")
- **Drishti** = What the planet wants to learn/achieve ("I want this")

### Examples

**Mercury:**
- In 3H (placement): Good in communication, writing, coding
- Aspect on 3H (drishti): Wants to be good in communication

**5th Lord in 8th House:**
- Either harms education
- Or gives education of occult
- Drishti on 2H: Asking family for assistance in education

## Aspect of Combust Planet

- Planet is irritated, drishti is also harsh
- **Exception**: Jupiter (remains benevolent even when combust)
- Benefic combust: Lachari (helplessness) in blessings
- Malefic combust: More aggressive
- Mars ko ast se zyada farak nahi padta (Mars less affected by combustion)

## Neech Graha Drishti (Debilitated Planet's Aspect)

**Benefic planet:**
- Asking for help
- Weakened blessings

**Malefic planet:**
- More harmful
- Aggressive demands

### Examples
- Saturn drishti on 4H from 7H: Suffering because of mother, feeling like stepchild
- Saturn drishti on 12H: Can't leave attachments, struggle with expenses and bondage

## Lordship vs Placement vs Drishti

### Complete Understanding

**Lordship** = Responsibility
- Defines **what** the planet must do
- Cannot change

**Placement** = Behavior/Environment
- Defines **how** the planet expresses
- Quality comes from where it sits
- Jahan baitha hai wo quality hai uska

**Drishti** = Desire
- Shows **where** the planet wants to act
- Temporary, time-bound
- Activates during Dasha

## Important Principles

### Permanence vs Temporariness
- Some things are permanent (like becoming CA or engineer)
- Some are temporary (desires through drishti)
- Drishti-related desires are time-bound (activate in Dasha)

### Own House Aspect
- Even malefic planet looking at its own house doesn't harm much
- **Exception**: Saturn will harm his own house (Saturn has no choice)
  - But tries to reduce damage in own house
- Mars won't harm its own house much
- Shubh graha aspect on its house makes it very strong

### Intention and Attention
- Jahan attention hoti hai wo grow karta hai (What gets attention grows)
- Jahan Jupiter ki drishti hai, attention do to growth and happiness
- Jahan Shani ki drishti hai, takat daalna bekar hai (Don't waste energy where Saturn aspects)

### Where to Put Effort?
- **Jahan Guru ki drishti hai** - Put effort there (will bear fruit)
- **Jahan Shani ki drishti hai** - Bring acceptance, surrender, dispassion

## Practical Summary

**Jupiter's Drishti**: Align your activities to maximize luck and growth
**Saturn's Drishti**: View obstacles as purification, bring acceptance
**Mars' Drishti**: Channel desire constructively, manage anger
**Rahu's Drishti**: Practice discernment, avoid illusions
