  * Afflicted Sun can lead to **misusing intelligence for selfish or destructive purposes**.

### 🔥 **Special Notes from the Transcript**

* **Sun + Mars in 5th House:**

  * Intensifies ego, **triggers extreme anger**.
  * Mars (anger, stubbornness) dominates; Sun becomes the decision-maker but Mars executes decisions rashly.

* **Fire vs. Other Elements on Intellect:**

  * **Fire (Agni) influence:** quick decisions, quick reversals (inconsistent thinking).
  * **Sky (Akash) or Jupiter influence:** brings **depth and wisdom**.

* **Shat Ripus (6 inner enemies – kama, krodha, lobha, moha, mada, matsarya):**

  * Sun, Jupiter, and Moon don’t create these ripus.
  * Afflicted Sun won’t create ripus itself, but if mixed with malefics, those negative traits can enter the intellect.

	- Kharab matlab - Venus, Rahu, KEtu or shani influence
