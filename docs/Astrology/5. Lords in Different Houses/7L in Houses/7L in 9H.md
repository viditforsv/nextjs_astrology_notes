# 7th Lord in 9th House

## 🔹 Concept Summary
- When the **7th Lord** moves into the **9th House**, marriage becomes tightly bound to **destiny, dharma, and fortune**.  
- Two interpretive schools exist:  
  1. **Second marriage** is seen from the **2nd house**.  
  2. **Alternate view:** second marriage arises from the **9th house** (third from 7th).  
- Thus, this position can indicate **multiple unions** or attachment to more than one partner — “one in hand, one in bush.”  
- **Spouse or relationships influence destiny** — women or partners shape fortune.  
- The **father** may live abroad (as the 9th represents father and foreign travel).  
- Marriage may lead to **foreign connection**, **travel**, or **business abroad**.  
- 9th house = house of **dharma**; marriage is sustainable **only when dharma is followed**.  
  - When dharmic duties (patni-dharma, pati-dharma) are upheld, marriage flourishes.  
  - When they are broken (lack of responsibility, sexual or moral imbalance), marriage collapses.  
- The **7th–9th link** connects partnership with **spirituality, justice, and law**.  
  - If afflicted → divorce or disputes through **judiciary or legal system**.  
- When **benefic and unafflicted**, this placement brings **fortune after marriage** — the spouse opens luck.  
- When **afflicted**, marriage brings misfortune — “life collapses after wedding.”
