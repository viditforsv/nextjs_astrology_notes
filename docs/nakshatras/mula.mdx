## Special Notes

Mula is considered a **Gandanta** (karmic knot) nakshatra - a spiritually sensitive point. It represents the ending of Scorpio's water element and beginning of Sagittarius's fire element.

**Important**: Mula has a reputation for being "destructive" but this is transformation, not mere destruction. Like pulling weeds by the root, it removes what doesn't serve growth.

Mula is NOT generally favorable for:
- Marriages (traditionally avoided)
- Starting long-term commitments
- Foundation ceremonies
- Planting crops

However, it IS excellent for:
- Spiritual practices
- Research and investigation
- Ending bad habits
- Demolition and clearing
- Getting to truth
- Philosophical studies

**Mula Dosha**: Babies born in Mula may require special rituals to ward off negative effects, especially concerning the father's well-being. Consult an experienced astrologer.

People born under Mula often go through significant transformations in life. They're seekers who won't rest until they find the ultimate truth. Their journey may involve uprooting themselves multiple times, but this leads to profound wisdom.
