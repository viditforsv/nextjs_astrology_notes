## Jupiter in 6th House (Shatru Sthana)

### Nature of Placement

* **Principle**: Wherever Jupiter sits, it causes *Staan Hani* (some loss) — here, it reduces debt (*Rin*), disease (*Rog*), and enemies (*Shatru*).
* **House quality**: 6th, 8th, and 12th are among the most impure houses.
* **Metaphor**: Jupiter here is like a diamond placed in garbage — diminished in spiritual potential.

### Career & Material Effects

* **10th House aspect**:

  * Gains energy from defeating enemies and channels it into career.
  * Strong professional success, but life’s ultimate objective (spirituality, soul-searching) is weakened.
  * Focus shifts to materialistic achievements.
* **12th House aspect**:

  * Reduces expenses.
  * Prevents loss of things meant to be taken away.
* **2nd House aspect**:

  * Increases wealth.

### Health Implications

* Jupiter = growth. Sitting in 6th (house of liver) can cause:

  * Fatty liver.
  * Issues in lower abdomen — liver, kidney, or related organs.
  * Depends on sign and planetary influence.

### Legal & Conflict Outcomes

* **Benefit**: If Jupiter is in or aspects the 6th house — even with many cases/accusations — the native comes out acquitted.
* **Reason**: Enemies are destroyed by their own actions.
* **Drawback**: Continuous arrival of enemies throughout life; native spends life engaged in these conflicts.

### Overall Orientation

* Strong in defeating opposition and material gains.
* Less focus on spiritual growth.
