### 6th Lord in 10th House — Notes

* **10th house** = karma, profession, public status.
* **6th lord here** → brings **struggle and competition in career**.
* Person rises **very high after hard work**; success comes **late but solid**.
* Strong indicator of **job/service life** (employment under someone).
* Combination of *6th lord in 10th* or *10th lord in 6th* = **job karma**.

**If benefic / well-placed:**

* Gains through **hard work and persistence** (Upachaya house effect).
* Becomes skilled, disciplined, courageous worker.
* Eventually **famous, respected, gifted speaker**, may **settle abroad**.

**If afflicted / malefic influence:**

* **Career instability**, frequent job changes.
* **Struggles with authority**, delays, or karmic obstacles.
* Taints one’s **dharma or ethics** — may compromise values for work.
* “Kills one’s dharma” → weakens faith or inner principles.

**Additional insights:**

* **Hard work is unavoidable**; constant effort needed for stability.
* **12th house periods (Dasha/Antardasha)** bring career loss or setbacks.
* For **Cancer Lagna**, Jupiter’s Dasha generally supports; others may disturb luck.

**Core idea:**

* **Work = battlefield**; victory only through persistence.
* The harder the struggle, the higher the rise.
