## **Ayurveda, Yoga & Astrology: The Vedic Secrets of Health & Karma — Full Transcript Summary**

### **Introduction**

* The speaker laments India's long-standing Western influence and neglect of its own systems.
* Ayurveda is misunderstood as only for curing disease. In truth, it is a **science of living**, not of herbs.
* Ayurveda, Yoga, and Astrology are **three branches of the same Vedic philosophy**.
* Pujas (rituals) don't heal directly, but they lead one to the **right treatment**.

---

### **Guest Introduction**

* Dr. Ajit, founder and director of **Ayurveda Wellness** in Auckland, merges Ayurvedic principles with Western medicine.
* He's president of the **International Council of Ayurvedic Medicine** and has launched Ayurvedic skincare products "Ayu."
* Alok Ji, founder and CEO of **Astrolok**, is an astrologer, entrepreneur, and motivational speaker who promotes astrology as a science. He has taught over **50,000 students** and given **36,000+ consultations**.

---

### **What Is Ayurveda?**

* Dr. Ajit defines Ayurveda as a **science that teaches how to live life once you've received it** — the *art of living*.
* The mistake: People use Ayurveda only as a **last resort**, as if it's an alternate medicine.
* Reality: **Herbs have no standalone role**; they are only a small part of a much larger science.
* Ayurveda, Yoga, and Astrology are **interconnected and inseparable** branches of one holistic philosophy.

---

### **Why the West Influences Our Thinking**

* For 200–300 years, Indians have valued their traditions only after Western validation — the "stamp of the West."
* Example: Yoga was Indian all along, but became popular only after Western endorsement.
* The same pattern is now happening with Ayurveda.
* Despite slow acceptance, the speaker asserts: the world cannot function sustainably without Ayurveda.

---

### **Connecting Astrology to Ayurveda**

* Alok explains: Everything in the universe — including humans — is composed of the **five great elements (Panch Mahabhutas)**.
* Every element corresponds to **planets (Grahas)**.
* Hence, the planets influence the body, and medicines act on those planetary vibrations.
* Diseases arise from **karmic imbalances** — e.g., a newborn with illness hasn't "done" anything in this life; it's karmic.
* To heal, you must balance the **planetary and physical dimensions**.

---

### **Threefold Healing Approach**

* The holistic system of treatment has **three M's**:

  1. **Meditation**
  2. **Medication**
  3. **Mantra**

* True healing combines these.

* Only when all three are balanced, does "the fourth M" — **Money** (ease in life) — come naturally.

---

### **Integration of All Three Systems**

* Since **Astrology is also part of the Vedas**, Ayurveda, Yoga, and Jyotish complement one another.
* You can heal through **Ayurveda (body)**, **Mantra (sound/vibration)**, **Yoga (breath and discipline)**, **Meditation**, and **Charity (Dana)** — all are valid remedies for planetary imbalance.

---

### **On Western Separation of Disciplines**

* Earlier, all Ayurvedic doctors were trained in Jyotish (astrology).
* Now, this connection is being reintroduced.
* The **Indian government has recently added "Graha Chikitsa (Planetary Therapy)"** as a compulsory subject in Ayurvedic syllabi.

---

### **How Ayurveda and Astrology Worked Together**

* In traditional hospitals, along with doctors, **Brahmins (priests)** worked alongside.
* The Ayurvedic doctor diagnosed based on **Nadi (pulse)** and planetary knowledge.
* Example: If Vata was high, and astrologically Rahu–Shani combination existed, he prescribed herbs *and* a **Rahu mantra**.
* Hence, earlier treatment combined medicine + mantra — not superstition, but **parallel diagnostics**.

---

### **Why the Integration Was Lost**

* Western science labeled this as myth, and Indians followed suit.
* Now, India is **progressively re-integrating** these Vedic sciences.
* No single remedy — neither medicine nor mantra — works alone; both are needed.

---

### **How Prayer Works in Healing**

* A Puja doesn't directly heal illness.
* It **guides the mind or the doctor** to the *right medicine*.
* The medicine then works effectively.
* This is called **"Daivyapashaya Chikitsa"** — divine-assisted treatment.

---

### **Astrological Diagnosis of Disease**

* Astrology can reveal which organ or body system may suffer.

  * For example, afflictions to certain houses (like 6th, 8th, or 12th) can indicate health issues.
* Ayurvedic doctors who understand astrology can design a more **targeted treatment plan**.

---

### **Power of Mantras**

* Diseases don't kill — **fear, anxiety, and worry** about diseases do.
* Chanting mantras like **Mahamrityunjaya, Gayatri, or Om** stabilizes body vibrations.
* The **seven chakras** (energy centers) are the foundation of health.
* Mantra and meditation keep these chakras aligned — making the person positive and receptive to treatment.

---

### **Lifestyle, Discrimination, and Wisdom (Viveka)**

* Right decision-making (Viveka) depends on balanced body and mind.
* Ayurveda promotes **Ritucharya (seasonal routine)** and **Dinacharya (daily routine)**.
* These sustain mental clarity.
* The real issue is modern impatience — everyone wants **quick fixes**, not long-term correction.

---

### **Ideal System of Healing**

* Ideally, one should:

  1. First consult an **Astrologer** for horoscope reading.
  2. Then go to the **Vaidya (Ayurvedic physician)** with astrological context.
  3. The Vaidya, trained in astrology, understands which **planetary period (Dasha)** is active (e.g., 6th, 8th, or 12th lord).
  4. He also checks pulse for **Vata, Pitta, Kapha** imbalance.
  5. Knowing which medicine corresponds to which planet, he prescribes accordingly.

* Thus, this becomes the **easiest, most accurate, and deeply diagnostic system** — a complete integration of spiritual, physical, and karmic medicine.

---

### **Modern Misconception**

* Today, people think:

  * *"Medicine should work instantly."*
  * *"Ayurveda is slow."*
  * *"Astrology is mystical."*
* But both Ayurveda and Jyotish deal with **root causes**, not surface symptoms.

---

### **Practical Astrological–Dietary Correlations**

* Alok gives examples:

  * **Malefic planet in 8th house → avoid related foods.**

    * Sun in 8th → no eggs.
    * Ketu in 8th → avoid fish.
    * Jupiter in 8th → no beef.
  * If **Mars** is malefic in 8th → avoid **tomatoes** or **hot milk**, as they increase Pitta.
  * **5th house** rules the stomach — if afflicted, **no fasting**, as it worsens Pitta and causes headaches.
* Thus, fasting isn't for everyone; remedies must match one's **planetary constitution**.

---

### **Integrative Prescription**

* When such astrological insights combine with mantra and medicine, results are **maximized**:

  * Mantra (spiritual vibration)
  * Puja or stone (planetary remedy)
  * Ayurveda (physical remedy)

---

### **Root Cause of Diseases (Conclusion)**

* According to Ayurveda, all diseases have only **two root causes**:

  1. **Pragyaparadha** — misuse of intellect (wrong actions, habits, thoughts)
  2. **Asatmya indriyartha samyoga** — wrong contact between senses and objects (overindulgence, imbalance)

* Healing, therefore, isn't about suppressing symptoms but **restoring alignment** between:

  * Body (Ayurveda)
  * Mind (Yoga & Meditation)
  * Karma and Planets (Astrology)

---

✅ **Essence:**
Ayurveda, Yoga, and Astrology are not separate sciences but **three expressions of one Vedic truth** — that health, destiny, and consciousness are inseparable. Real healing happens when body, mind, and karma are all brought into harmony through **medicine, mantra, and mindfulness**.

Here's a **chronological English summary** of the **(16:37–35:50)** portion of _"Ayurveda, Yoga & Astrology: The Vedic Secrets of Health & Karma"_ — complete, precise, and nothing skipped or added:

---

## **Ayurveda, Yoga & Astrology – Part 2 Summary (16:37–35:50)**

### **1. The Two Roots of Human Life: Habits and Thoughts**

- Dr. Ajit explains that life has two main aspects:
    
    - **Habits** – lifestyle, diet, environment, and daily surroundings.
        
    - **Thoughts** – mental, emotional, and spiritual states.
        
- Illness arises when one doesn't understand the need to transform these two.
    
- In India, people typically blame either:
    
    - **Black magic from neighbors**, or
        
    - **Bad karma** for their suffering.
        
- But both are simply karmic results — whether **current (Kriyamana)** or **past (Prarabdha)**.
    
- Astrology shows the **"roadmap ahead"** — where the pitfalls are so that one can avoid them in time.
    
---

### **2. Astrology and Precaution**

- Scriptures may warn: _"You're under threat from iron or machinery"_ — meaning possible car accidents.
    
- The message isn't to stop driving — it's to drive **carefully and slowly**.
    
- Astrology gives **precaution**, not fear.
    
---

### **3. The Role of Gemstones (Ratnas)**

- In Ayurveda, gemstones have physical and energetic importance:
    
    - They are converted into **Bhasma (calcined ashes)** — e.g., diamond bhasma, pearl bhasma, ruby bhasma — each serving different treatments.
        
    - Astrology prescribes gems (like coral or ruby) corresponding to planets, because **their vibration aids planetary balance**.
        
- These can even be mixed into ghee and consumed medicinally when properly prepared.
    
---

### **4. The Science Behind It**

- Ayurveda, Yoga, and Astrology are not superstition but **applied sciences of vibration and karma**.
    
- Past life (previous birth) actions influence health now.
    
    - Example: _Stealing clothes in a past life leads to skin itching in this one._
        
- The return of karma doesn't always mirror the act — it may manifest as:
    
    - **Disease**,
        
    - **Humiliation**, or
        
    - **Poverty**.
        
Thus, healing involves four interlinked factors:

1. **Current karma**
    
2. **Past life karma**
    
3. **Current lifestyle**
    
4. **Birth chart**
    
These together form the **holistic circle** of Ayurveda.

---

### **5. Clarifying a Misconception – "Massage" vs "Bodywork"**

- Ayurveda doesn't have "massages" — it has **bodywork treatments**.
    
- True Ayurvedic oils take **2–3 months** to prepare, using specific herbs.
    
- Each bodywork treatment is prescribed **after identifying the bodily imbalance**.
    
- Unlike lifestyle changes (which take time), **bodywork gives deep, immediate detox** by flushing toxins through the seven _Dhatus_ (tissues) and 13 channels (_Srotas_).
    
---

### **6. The Planet–Body Connection**

- The **seven Dhatus** correspond to the **seven planets**;
    
    - the **seven Chakras** also correspond to the same seven planets.
        
- Everything — planetary, physical, and spiritual — is **one circle**.
    
- If you hold onto one aspect sincerely (be it Yoga, Ayurveda, or Astrology), others automatically follow.
    
- Spiritual growth naturally leads to dietary awareness and Ayurveda practice.
    
---

### **7. Natural Transition through Yoga**

- Most people start Yoga with **Asanas**, but as they evolve, they feel drawn to change habits — especially to reduce non-vegetarian food.
    
- The shift from meat to sattvic food happens naturally because **Yoga's goal is connection (union)**.
    
- As spiritual awareness rises, indulgent habits drop on their own.
    
---

### **8. Chronic Illness and Faith**

- In cases of chronic disease (e.g., 8th-house or 6th-house afflictions in charts), Ayurveda can **absolutely help**, but the **patient's trust** is essential.
    
- The problem: patients become addicted to allopathic quick fixes.
    
- Ayurveda and Astrology are **preventive**, not emergency sciences.
    
- Visiting a Jyotishi or Vaidya **after** the disease strikes is too late — like consulting after Shani's _Sade Sati_ has already begun.
    
---

### **9. Preventive, Monthly Practice**

- Ideally, one should visit an **Ayurvedic doctor and astrologer monthly** for maintenance.
    
- The pulse shows early imbalances — e.g., Vata increasing before it becomes disease.
    
- The chart already reveals future tendencies — e.g., liver problems visible years in advance.
    
- **Ayurveda intervenes before karma turns painful** — converting the "sword into a needle."
    
- You still experience the karma, but with reduced intensity.
    
---

### **10. Cancer Treatment and Integration**

- Many cancer patients come to Ayurveda.
    
- The Ayurvedic doctor must identify the **stage** (2nd, 3rd, etc.).
    
- Allopathic treatments like **chemo, radiation, or surgery** continue, but without lifestyle correction, they fail to sustain results.
    
- Oncologists don't guide about food, alcohol, or coffee — Ayurveda does.
    
- Astrology contributes mentally — if an astrologer told the patient, "You'll recover after this bad phase," that **faith itself becomes the most powerful medicine**.
    
- Thus, the mind, belief, and karmic assurance activate healing energy.
    
---

### **11. Real-Life Example**

- The host shares her own story — doctors advised urgent uterus removal (suspected cancer), but she refused immediate surgery and met the astrologer just in time.
    
- She relates that Western medicine often removes organs too fast, even in India now — with little patience for holistic healing.
    
- Once an organ is gone, healing becomes much harder.
    
---

### **12. Ayurveda for Children and Pregnancy**

- Ayurveda can be given **from any age**, even to infants.
    
- However, the **root of child health lies in the mother**.
    
- Modern pregnancies are unplanned — Ayurveda insists on **planned conception** with _Garbha Sanskar_ (spiritual prenatal development).
    
- The ancient system has stages:
    
    1. **Garbha Sanskar** – purifying mind and body before conception.
        
    2. **Garbhini Paricharya** – lifestyle of the pregnant mother.
        
    3. **Soothika Paricharya** – postnatal care.
        
- Today, we label children easily ("ADHD", "OCD", "Autism") without asking _why_ these arise.
    
- The cause is **mother's disturbed lifestyle, diet, or emotional state** during pregnancy.
    
---

### **13. The Mahabharata Example**

- During Mahabharata, Abhimanyu learned half the war strategy while in his mother's womb — because his mother fell asleep mid-way.
    
- The fetus absorbs **vibrations and thoughts** of the mother.
    
    - Hearing noble teachings yields noble tendencies;
        
    - hearing negativity affects the child likewise.
        
- Each of the **nine months** corresponds to the **nine planets**.
    
- Each month's Ayurvedic process strengthens a specific planet — this is how _divine children_ were cultivated.
    
---

### **14. Creating a Divine Child**

- Before conception:
    
    - Parents should check their **mental and physical readiness**.
        
    - Choose conception **according to planetary tithis**.
        
- During nine months:
    
    - Each month focuses on strengthening one of the nine planets using **specific medicines and mantras**.
        
- This way, half of the child's future problems can be resolved _before birth_.
    
- Still, karmic patterns remain — but suffering is minimized (the "bullet becomes a pellet").
    
---

### **15. The Need for Integration**

- Combining Ayurveda and Astrology can massively uplift humanity — especially in the Western world.
    
- This science reveals **timing** — when danger or disease may come — allowing proactive action.
    
- People misunderstand astrology as fortune-telling for wealth, but its purpose is **timely awareness and prevention**.
    
- The future can be improved if we act wisely in the present.
    
---

### **16. Final Advice**

- **Step 1:** Consult an **authentic astrologer** (not social media entertainers).
    
- **Step 2:** Learn your **body type** (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) and **planetary tendencies**.
    
- **Step 3:** Keep a **permanent Ayurvedic practitioner** for ongoing balance.
    
- Awareness of planetary periods (good/bad times) helps in decision-making and motivation.
    
- **Food determines 80% of your life.**
    
    - "As is your food, so will be your mind."
        
    - Mind shapes actions → actions shape karma.
        
---

### **17. Ayurveda and Modern Students**

- Dr. Ajit concludes:
    
    - Western medicine has its place — it provides quick fixes.
        
    - But it **doesn't teach prevention** or mental/emotional balance.
        
    - Ayurveda, Yoga, and Astrology fill this gap by addressing root causes and timing.
        
    - The future must integrate all three systems — not for business, but for **public service and collective wellbeing**.
        
---

✅ **Essence of Part 2:**  
Health, destiny, and consciousness are one continuum.  
Past karma, present lifestyle, planetary cycles, and inner thoughts co-create our reality.  
When **Ayurveda (body), Yoga (discipline), and Astrology (timing)** unite — healing becomes not just recovery, but **self-realization**.
