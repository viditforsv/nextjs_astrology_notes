* **3rd lord in 9th house**:

  * 9H = dharma, spirituality, higher knowledge, long travels, foreign connection.
  * If **benefically influenced** → makes the native **religious, spiritual, charitable**, may work in **publications, religious literature, training, or astrology**.
  * If **malefically influenced** → can make the person **hypocritical (false religiosity)**.

* **Effort (3H) focus:**

  * 3H shows where effort is directed.
  * If 3L is in 9H → the person must put **effort into spirituality, religion, meditation, and dharma**.
  * These things do not come naturally; the native must **work hard** for them.

* **Wealth/charity angle:**

  * Benefic influence → person becomes **donative, generous**.
  * Malefic influence → person may misuse or take money meant for religion.

* **Travel and foreign settlement:**

  * 3H = short journeys.
  * 9H = long journeys.
  * Connection between them → frequent travels abroad.
  * If supported by 7H and 12H → possibility of **settling in foreign lands**.
  * Thus, 9H is very important for foreign travel/settlement, though 7H and 12H are also needed.
