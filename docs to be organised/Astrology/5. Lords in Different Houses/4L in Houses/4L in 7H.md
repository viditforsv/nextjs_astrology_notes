* **4th House** → mind, education, happiness, property, mother.
* **7th House** → spouse, marriage, business, desires, public dealings.

### 🌿 General Nature

* When the **4th lord goes to the 7th house**, it connects **two kendras** — a strong and auspicious link.
* **Moon and Venus**, being the natural lords of the 4th, aspect the **Lagna** from the 7th, making the person **intelligent and attractive**.

### 💍 Happiness and Relationships

* The person **seeks happiness through the spouse**.
* Since the 7th is **4th from the 4th**, it represents **happiness derived through marriage or partnership**.
* If unafflicted → the person will **seek and also receive happiness from spouse**.

### 🏠 Property & Business

* 4th = property; 7th = business → this placement supports **business in property or land-related fields**.
* Being *bhava bhavam* (4th from the 4th), it strengthens the 4th-house significations.
* Such a person has **natural intelligence regarding real estate or property matters**.
* Native may gain **properties through spouse**, or **in the spouse’s name**.

### ❤️ Desires and Delays

* The 7th house is also the **house of desires**.
* The person continually **aspires for something new** — happiness is often sought externally.
* Planets in the 7th give **delayed results**, so property, comforts, or marital happiness may come **in the later part of life**.

### ⚠️ If Afflicted

* If afflicted →

  * The native may **not get happiness from spouse**.
  * Can lead to **multiple relationships** (especially if Moon is involved, due to its speed and attraction).
  * **Mind may become lustful** — finding pleasure through sensory or relationship indulgence.
  * Public speech or expression may be weak — such people often **stay silent in meetings** or speak later.
  * The person may **leave or lose paternal property**, since 4th lord moves to the **12th from the 8th** (loss of inheritance).

### 🌸 Summary

* **Good (Unafflicted)** → Happiness through spouse, property gains via marriage, charm, intelligence, business success in property.
* **Afflicted** → Marital discontent, indulgence, delayed happiness, leaving paternal property, or weakness in public speech.
