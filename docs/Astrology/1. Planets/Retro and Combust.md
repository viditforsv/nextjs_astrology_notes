- Rashi ka Digpal - Owner of the Rashi
- Neech and Param Neech
	- Param neech uth bhi nahi paata, very negative results

## 🌌 **Vedic Astrology Class Notes — Planetary States (Avasthas)**

### 🔰 **Four Major States of a Planet**

1. **Exalted (Uccha)**
2. **Own Sign (Swagrahi/Swarashi)**
3. **Mool Trikona**
4. **Debilitated (Neecha)**

### 🧩 **In-Between States**(ग्रह मैत्रेयी)

* Between exaltation and debilitation, a planet may reside in:

  * **Friendly signs** → supportive but not as powerful.
  * **Neutral signs** → indifferent influence.
  * **Enemy signs** → potential friction or loss of strength.

## 🔁 **Retrograde Planets (Vakri Graha)**

### 🔍 **What Is Retrograde?**

* Apparent backward motion of a planet as seen from Earth.
* Happens when a planet comes closest to Earth and farthest from the Sun.
* It **appears** to move backward due to relative speed and position.
* Common analogy: Train moving forward while platform appears to move backward.

### 🌍 **Astronomical Context**

* All planets orbit the Sun at different speeds.
* When a planet is \~6th, 7th, 8th (up to \~9th) from the Sun in a chart → it is farthest from Sun and appears retrograde.
* Retrograde begins \~130° to 220° from the Sun.
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nVSzzYCAYk&t=1s - Explanation of how retrogation works

### 🔥 **Impact of Retrograde**

* **Increased proximity to Earth** → stronger influence.
* Gains **Cheshta Bala** (impulse/desire to act).
* Moves out of Sun's control → becomes rebellious or non-conforming.
* Behaves in unusual, unexpected, or mysterious ways.

---

### ⚙️ **Prediction Principles**

* If a planet is retrograde in the birth chart:

  * **Marked as "R"** (English charts) or **"वा"** (Hindi charts) or **"+"** in some software.
  * It indicates **pending karmic lessons** from past lives.

* **More retrograde planets = more internal pressure and complexity**

  * 1 Retrograde → manageable, like one boss.
  * 2–3 → too many conflicting demands.
  * You feel talented but scattered and pulled in many directions.
  * Graha is not willing to listed to sun
  * Retro Planets can be very good or very bad. 
	  * That affect can be strong
	  * Unusual
	  * Does not want to follow rules
	  * Post martum of situation
	  * In retrospection or in the past
	  * Pending karma for that planet
		  * Wants to get rid of the past karma
	  * Mysterious planet
	  * Anxieties and Frustration and delay
	  * Not in the present moment, in the past.
		  * Not able to enjoy ras in present life, but rather than in dreams. 
	  * Native is very skillful
		  * but unable to perform very well
		  * too many bosses - planetary
		  * Unable to focus on 1 thing
		  * Strong ambition
		  * Day dreaming
		  * Confusion
	  * Planet may give unexpected results
	  * 
  * When Shubh graha(Ju, Me, and Ve) is Retro
	  * Their affect is large
- When paap graha is vakri(Sa,Ma)
	- More aggressive

### 🔄 **Planets & Retrogression**

| Planet                                | Can Be Retrograde? | Notes                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Sun & Moon                            | ❌ No               | Never retrograde                                  |
| Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Saturn | ✅ Yes              | Commonly retrograde                               |
| Rahu & Ketu                           | ✅ Always           | Permanently retrograde (move backward by default) |

---

### 📊 **Effect by Type of Planet**

* **Benefics (Venus, Mercury, Jupiter)** → Retrograde makes them **even more beneficial** (with stronger intention).
* **Malefics (Mars, Saturn)** → Retrograde makes them **more intense/aggressive**.
* **Rahu-Ketu** → Already moving backward, so not considered ‘retrograde’ in this context.

---

### 🧠 **Psychological Impact**

* Retrograde = internalization of the planet's traits.
* You may feel like you're always "returning" to complete something.
* Delays bring **maturity**, not denial.

---

### 🕐 **Timing**

* Retrograde planet gives **results in the second or third phase** of life.
* **Saturn retrograde** → often delays results until **age 36–40+**.

---

### 🎯 **Practical Takeaways**

* Retrograde planet = **strong but delayed karma activation**.
* Brings:

  1. **Delay**
  2. **Desire (Cheshta Bala)**
  3. **Frustration**
* Retrograde planets push you toward introspection, completion of old cycles, and can lead to mastery if accepted with patience.


#### 🔹 General Principles:

* Vakri planets do not behave linearly—they introspect, repeat, and delay.
* Represent **pending karmas** from past life—tasks left incomplete or misused responsibilities.
* Vakri = Cheshtha Bal (effort-driven intensity).

  * Can cause intense spiritual hunger and service without seeking rewards.

* **Budh (Mercury)**:

  * Super intelligent but introverted.
  * Over-analyzes; may speak less but with precision.
  * Strong comic + common sense.
  * Known for **reverse logic** or saying unexpected things.
  * Confused yet insightful; often misjudged in meetings but brilliant in hindsight.

* **Mangal (Mars)**:

  * Misused or underused power in past life.
  * In this life, creates **anxiety, frustration, anger**.
  * Tendency to **start fast but leave things incomplete**.
  * Always in a rush, leading to burnout and oversight.
  * Relief after 28 years

* **Shukra (Venus)**:

  * Romantic karma pending.
  * First major relationship is **painful, incomplete, or karmic**.
  * Second relationship brings clarity.
  * Creates intense desire for love, luxury, and sensual experiences.
  * Emotional relationships often delayed till **after age 30**.
  * 1st relationship would be painful
  * Either would not want to marry

### 🔥 **Asta Graha (Combust Planets)**

#### 🔹 General Concepts:

* A planet is **combust (Asta)** when it comes too close to the Sun.
* Sun burns the planet, making it **weak + agitated**.
* Combustion ≠ retrograde; it means the planet’s **influence is suppressed**.
* Planet loses visibility (symbolically and literally)—its **karakatva fades**.

#### 🔹 Interpretation:

* **Planet’s talents fade**; person feels emotionally distant or disconnected from those areas.
* Planet becomes "kshubhit" (disturbed) — leads to **anger, irritation, frustration**.
* The closer to the Sun, the **more burnt out** and **weaker the expression**.

#### 🔹 Planet-wise Combust Patterns:

* **Budh (Mercury)**:

  * Frequent combustion due to closeness to Sun.
  * Logic and speech may be impaired.

* **Shukra (Venus)**:

  * Gets combust often due to orbital proximity.
  * Affects relationships and artistic abilities.

* **Chandra (Moon)**:

  * Combust Moon = **Amavasya**.
  * Mind/emotions suppressed. Emotional expression is weak or disturbed.

### 📉 Strength Phases in Vakri Motion (Shad Avastha):

| Stage         | Description                          | Strength (%) |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| **Manda**     | Planet slows before retrograde       | 30%          |
| **Manda-Tar** | Slower than Manda                    | 15%          |
| **Vikal**     | Stationary (just before/after retro) | 15%          |
| **Vakri**     | Retrograde motion, full cheshtha bal | 100%         |
| **Sam**       | Just begun moving direct, unstable   | 7.5%         |
| **Chara**     | Moving normally again                | 45%          |
| **Atichari**  | Overcompensating with fast motion    | Up to 200%   |

| Planet  | Longitudinal Range                              |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Moon    | $\pm 12^\circ$                                  |
| Mercury | $\pm 12^\circ$ or $\pm14^\circ$ (if retrograde) |

| Mars    | $\pm 17^\circ$                                  |
| Saturn  | $\pm 15^\circ$                                  |
- Planet within $\pm1^\circ$ are totally burnt. Their karakatwa is totally obstructed. 
---

### 💡 Summary Points:

* Vakri = Karmic push to complete the pending work.
* Asta = Loss of power/influence due to being too close to ego/Sun.
* Both are **not inherently negative**, but they demand **patience, awareness, and correction**.
* Each retrograde planet = **a karmic echo from past life** — it wants to finish its business.
* **Combustion starts** when a planet enters within ±12° to ±13° of the Sun, regardless of Rashi boundary.
* **There are no borders in the sky** — planets can be combust even if in different Rashis but within the degree range.
* **Planet very close to Sun (e.g., 19° vs 20°)** → fully combust, maximum burning, zero autonomy.
* **More degree difference** → less combustion effect.
* **Combust planet = strength pulled by Sun**: either protected or power suppressed.
* **Two meanings of combustion**:

  * (1) Sun takes over the planet's responsibility.
  * (2) Sun suppresses the planet’s independence.
* **Sun = King / Father**. Any planet close to the king loses its voice/autonomy.
* **Combustion = Not speaking up, suppressed voice, internalized intelligence**.



### 🌀 **Retrograde (Vakri) – Spiritual/Karmic Layers**

* Retrograde ≠ actual planetary backward motion; it's **relative motion as seen from Earth**.
* **Vakri = Strength, desire, internal fire**. Planet gains strength *against* the Sun.
* **Retrograde + Combust** = paradoxical state:

  * Protected yet rebellious.
  * Silent yet calculating.
  * Suppressed outwardly, but deeply active inwardly.
* **Retrograde teaches patience**: Planet is revisiting unresolved karma (e.g., Guru not respected in past life → Jupiter retrograde).
* **Retrograde = Cheshtha Bala (effort power)**: Planets never give up, highly driven.

---
- When mercury is both Retro and combust, such natives are intelligent and cultured
- Venus when retro and combust
	- powerful yet restricted
	- Native with x factor of venus but restricted by sun thus within the bounds of their guardian
	- Spouse of native will be sickly
	- Restricted in relationships
		- samaj ke saamne restrict ho jaega

### 🧠 **Mercury and Venus – Unique Planets**

* Mercury & Venus never go more than **1–2 Rashis** away from Sun.
* Both can be **Retrograde + Combust simultaneously**.
* **Such people are**:
  * Highly intelligent.
  * Reserved.
  * Calculative.
  * Often misjudged but very cultured.
* **Combust Mercury**: Silent intellect, protected mind, speaks less.
* **Combust Venus**: Restricted sensuality, beauty suppressed by societal norms, deep cultural discipline.

---

### 💏 **Relationship Impacts of Combust Venus**

* Spouse's health may suffer.
* Person may feel emotionally or publicly restricted in expressing love.
* Venus = expression, beauty, sensuality — gets burned or evaporated near Sun.
* Such people may:

  * Appear detached in public.
  * Avoid PDA (Public Display of Affection).
  * Feel limited in romantic expression due to social/familial constraints.

---

### 👨‍👧 **Sun's Role as Protector and Authority**

* **Sun combusting a planet** = Taking over duties (e.g., if 5th lord combust → Sun handles child karma).
* **Combust planets = under Sun’s control**, acting on behalf of the combust lord’s domain.
* **Interpretation depends on**: what house the combust planet rules and where Sun is placed.

---

### ⚖️ **Retrograde + Combust Effects Combined**

* The planet is **protected + empowered simultaneously**.
* Example: Retro Venus → rebellious about norms; Combust Venus → restricted externally → results in a disciplined romantic expression.
* **Such people often exhibit**:

  * Misfit yet refined behavior.
  * Culture under suppression.
  * Deep karmic intelligence.

---

### 🔁 **Retrograde and Combustion Together = Dual Role**

* **Sun gives shelter**, but also **burns independence**.
* Person may look subdued but is highly aware and calculating.
* These people are often deeply involved in responsibilities and spiritual refinement.

## 🌞 **Combustion and Eclipses**

* Combustion happens regardless of eclipses — **Sun burns any planet** near it (\~12°).
* **Ketu eclipses the Sun**, but that doesn’t stop the Sun from combusting other planets like Guru or Chandra.
* If **Sun is eclipsed by Ketu and combusting Guru**, it worsens the combustion due to Sun’s weakened energy.
* Despite this, **Ketu + Surya is good for spirituality**, especially in the 8th house.
* **Ketu doesn’t get combust** — it combusts/eclipses the Sun instead.
* **Ketu loves Surya** (both Sattvic). **Surya hates Rahu**.
* **Chandra + Ketu** also gives deep spiritual insight.

---

## 🌀 **Retrograde Planets (Vakri Grahas)**

* **Some planets can be retrograde and combust together** (e.g., Mars, Venus, Mercury). Rare but intense.
* Retrograde + Combust = High internal energy, suppressed expression, and karmic weight.
* **Stammering** can be linked to **retrograde Mercury**: internal overthinking disconnects speech and brain.
* Give such individuals **confidence and expression** – the block releases.

---

## 🧘‍♂️ **Spiritual and Karmic Insights (Retro Planets)**

* **Saturn retro in 9th house (Dharmasthana)**:

  * Indicates **past-life rigid beliefs** or religious dogma.
  * Current life may show **intolerance or exclusivity** in spiritual views.
* Retro planet’s house = unfinished karmic area from the past.
* **Degrees of retrogression matter** for personal evolution and timing of effects.

---

## 📅 **Transit Retrograde vs Natal Retrograde**

* Even if a **birth chart has no retro planets**, current transits affect natives.
* During Saturn retro (transit), those without natal retro Saturn may face slowdowns.
* Those with natal Saturn retro will **benefit during Saturn retro phase** (4 months/year).
* **Non-retro natives** feel more external obstacles during planetary retrograde periods.

---

## ⚖️ **House vs Sign Effects**

* Even if **Venus is in its own sign (e.g., Libra)**, if it's in the 6th house, it suffers.
* **6th house = Virgo energy** → not supportive of Venus.
* This creates a **paradox**: dignity from sign, but conflict from house position.
* Concept: **“Marana Karaka Sthana”** – Venus suffers in 6th even if in Mool Trikona.

---

## 🧠 **Memory and Remedies**

* Memory retention issues?

  * Do **Pranayama**.
  * Chant **“Om Vishnave Namah”**.
  * Take **Meda Rasayana** (Ayurvedic supplement for brain health).

---

## 🌑 **Amavasya (New Moon)**

* **Moon is not combust**, but **Amavasya Moon is considered extremely weak**.
* No "Manas" (mind) energy → emotionally blank state.
* Amavasya Moon = internalized, hidden emotional world.

---

## 💔 **Venus Retrograde & Relationships**

* Venus retro leads to:

  * **Delay in first relationship**, or
  * **Dissatisfaction, duality, fantasy** in early bonds.
* First relationship may be late or unfulfilling, even if it happens after 30.
* Venus retro is deeply **sensual and complex** – desires are often hidden or conflicted.

---

## 🔮 **Ketu in the 8th House**

* Ketu in 8th = **mystical death**, hidden knowledge, spiritual power.
* May connect with:
  * Astrology
  * Mysticism
  * Occult
* Need to be careful of **accidents**; spiritual progress is strong.

---

## 💼 **Saturn Retrograde in the 6th House**

* Very powerful for **beating enemies, diseases, and competition**.
* But Saturn activates **fully after age 32–36**.
* Before that: restrictions, delays, and slow growth.
* Post-36: powerful momentum, no obstacles, continuous results.

---

## 📈 **Multiple Retrograde Planets**

* Jupiter, Saturn, Mars all retro = **super strong native**, but with a **very difficult life**.
* These natives:
  * Work 18–20 hours a day
  * Constantly shift roles and careers
  * Carry heavy karmic load
* Retro planets **don’t let you die easily** — they prolong life to finish karma.
* During **Ayurvedic age calculations**, retro planets’ years are **doubled** due to pending karma.

---

## 🧘 **General Insights**

* **High dignity planets** (own sign or exalted) are good **even in difficult houses** like the 8th.
* Example: Jupiter in Sagittarius in 8th = not bad → deep knowledge, spiritual transformation.
* **Sun + Saturn in same house, same degree**: intense karmic friction, emotions suppressed.

- Stammering is due to mercury retro
- Retro jis bhav main hai us bhav se related pending karmas

### Shani retro in 9th house
- Native in previous life provoked violence for other religions
- May hate other religions

- When Shani is vakri in someone's rashi and when gochar main shani vakri nahi hote to native ka kaam slow ho jaata hai, but when vakri shani comes back then unke kaam fatafat hote hain. 

### Shani in 6H at Retro 
- Good Shani
- Shatru harta


Uccha planet if vakri gives results of neech like
	- resources are given but unable to use
	- Give over confidence
	- eg: Jupiter uccha and vakri
		- knowledge bahut hai lekin mis interpret karega
- Swarashi + Vakri is like uccha
- When a planet is vakri (retrograde), it behaves like it is exalted or in its mooltrikona.
- neech planet if vakri gives results of uccha like
	- no resources but reach great height
- Uccha means given by nature, uccha like is that one has to aquire by hard work. 
### General 
- Jo planet ast hai to usse related relation ki tabyat kharab rahegi
- Ast graha does not take intellectual capabilities of the planet but the physical capabilities
	- eg: Mercury - speech etc are not affected
- eg: if 7L is combust
	- in case of wife one will have to do tapasya
- eg: if 11L is combust then one will have to work harder to earn money


- When graha is combust then the plant is ahead of behind?
	- when graha is behind
		- eg 18degree of planet and 20 degree sun
		- planet was approaching the sun
		- planet will experience this for major part of life
	- when graha is ahead
		- The native will feel a little relaxed


### Vakri (Retrograde) Planets:

* Vakri in its own sign (swagrahi) becomes very powerful, like it's striving for ucha (exaltation).
* Retrogression induces cheshta (striving), a drive to rise.
* If a planet is *neecha* and *vakri*, the native will rise to the top *after a lot of struggle*.
* If a planet is *uchcha* and *vakri*, there is high chance of *fall from grace*. It gives overconfidence.

Example:

* A teacher with exalted Guru may think they can teach without prep, but fall flat due to overconfidence.

---

### Combustion (Asta):

* Combustion means the planet is too close to the Sun, losing its physical strength.
* Physical traits (body, health, relations) governed by that planet will suffer.
* Psychological traits (like Mercury = speech, Venus = creativity) may remain unaffected.

Types:

1. **Planet behind the Sun**: Planet is approaching combustion; the person will experience the burn *in this life*.
2. **Planet ahead of the Sun**: Person has already experienced combustion *in past life* and carries the residue.

Effects:

* Venus combust = issues with wife, frustration in relationships.
* Mars combust = issues with brothers.
* Mercury combust = hesitance in communication.

Planet in combustion zone leads to:

* Anxiety
* Anger
* Restlessness

Example:

* Being placed on a hot tawa – person feels irritated, agitated.

During its *dasha*, an asta planet causes:

* Tapasya (heat, struggle) in areas ruled by that planet.
* Example: If Guru (Jupiter) is combust and is 11th lord, during its dasha income will be burnt or blocked.

---

### Interpretation Using Degrees:

* Sun at 20°, Moon at 18° → Moon behind Sun → Moon combust will affect this life.
* Sun at 18°, Mercury at 24° → Mercury ahead of Sun → Mercury combusted in last life → residue in this life.

---

### Examples:

**Chart Case**

* Sun: 18.35°
* Moon: 15.25° (Moon behind Sun, approaching combustion → tapasyā in this life, especially related to 3rd house = siblings)
* Saturn: 8° (far from Sun, but will slowly combust → issues in later life, esp. in karma/career)
* Mercury: 20.34° (ahead of Sun, combust in past life → hesitation, unacknowledged speech issues)

---

### Summary:

* Neech + Vakri → Gives exalted-like results after hard effort.
* Uccha + Vakri → Fall due to overconfidence.
* Swagrahi + Vakri → Powerful and ambitious.
* Asta planet → Physical results suffer, psychological traits survive.
* Degrees matter: planet behind Sun = combustion to come (this life); ahead = combustion gone (last life).

---

### Final Takeaways:

* Combustion is not just malefic; it's tapas, refinement.
* Retrogression is not weakness; it’s deep desire to rise.
* Aspect shows communication, desire, and influence.
* Always judge combustion and vakri results using house ownership, degrees, and house placement.

![[Pasted image 20250621183519.png]]
In this chart, moon, mercury and shani are combust
- native will experience emotional pain from younger siblings because moon is in 3H
- Moon is behind sun
- Saturn is also approaching sun
	- saturn is very far that means saturn related issues with work related thins in 2nd phase of life
	- since saturn is lord of 10H and 9H
- Mercury is ahead of sun
	- Native experienced in previous lives and little less in this life
