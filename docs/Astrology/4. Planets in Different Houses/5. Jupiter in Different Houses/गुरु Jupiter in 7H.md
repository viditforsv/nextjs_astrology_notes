## Jupiter in 7th House (Saptam Sthana)

### Nature of Placement

* **Paradox**: Common assumption is that Jupiter in 7th ensures a smooth marriage — but reality is different.
* **Reason**: 7th house = spouse, relationships, sex; it’s Venus’ natural house. Jupiter here becomes slightly impure (*ashuddh*), thus uncomfortable.
* Can create **marital problems**, especially if alone and unafflicted by benefic influence.

### Benefic Influence

* If a benefic aspect joins Jupiter here:

  * Raises life standards.
  * Person becomes religious (due to aspect on Lagna).
  * Gains intelligence, focus, high values.
  * Strong attraction from opposite sex.

### Public & Social Life

* **7th aspect on Lagna**:

  * Increases intelligence, places intellect above emotions.
  * Attractive personality; liked by opposite sex.
* **Fortune after marriage**: Common — marriage triggers rise in luck and fortune.
* 7th house = world outside self → public life becomes significant.
* Person devotes more time to social/public work than to spouse.

### Spouse Traits

* Spouse resembles Jupiter: religious, from a noble family, follows social norms.
* Supportive partner.

### Marital Challenges

* Jupiter here causes *Staan Hani* for marriage — native spends more time in public/professional domains than personal life.
* If afflicted:
  * High chance of divorce (even if 7th lord exalted).
  * In male charts: possible attraction towards others’ wives (social reputation remains high; intent may not manifest).
* Benefic aspect or *yogakaraka* planet’s influence can save marriage.

### Longevity & Personality

* Considered very good for **longevity**:

  * Aspect on Lagna increases lifespan and health.
  * Even with other Ayu factors weak, Jupiter here can prolong life.
* Jupiter is symbolically 16 years old → natives appear younger than actual age.
* Friendly, approachable, easily connects with people.
* Public life tends to be large and influential.

### Summary

* **Not great for marriage** (unless benefic influence present).
* **Very good for**: longevity, personality, intelligence, public profile, supportive spouse in non-romantic aspects.
