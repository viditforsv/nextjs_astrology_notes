* **7th house basics (per text):** spouse/partner, meditation, *pad-prāpti* (status/throne), also a **māraka** house; mirror of Lagna.

* **Saturn’s status here:** gets **digbala**; in Kālapuruṣa, 7th = **Libra (Saturn exalted)**; house of friend **Venus**. Still, Saturn = **duḥkha** wherever it sits.

* **Marriage & spouse:**

  * Creates **sorrow/shortfall of expectations** in marriage; **delays marital bliss**.
  * **On the day of marriage** the native is **not happy** (if Saturn is in/fully aspecting the 7th).
  * **Retrograde Saturn** → **high sexual desire**; **non-retrograde** → **low sexual desire** and **less physical intimacy**.
  * **“Takes the juice”** out of marriage—emotional intimacy also dries up.
  * **Body afflicted**; **wife thin/lean**.
  * If **exalted/own sign** → **intimacy with many females**.
    If **enemy sign/other signs** → **sorrow from marriage**.
  * **Doesn’t necessarily break marriage**: if Saturn is **alone**, the person **stays married** but **pays karmic installments** for long; constant **ideological differences** and an urge to **mold the spouse**.
  * If **enemy sign + another malefic**, can cause **loss of wife**.

* **Aspects & side effects (as stated):**

  * **Aspect to Lagna** → **laziness**, **illness**.
  * **3rd aspect to 9th** → hides father’s mistakes, **affliction from father**, **delays dharma**.
  * 7th is **foreign**; Saturn signifies **foreign** → **appreciation/awards in foreign lands** possible.

* **Health:** Saturn as **karaka of 6th** seated in a **māraka** house → “many diseases,” **lower abdomen afflicted**.

* **Mindset stamp:** Saturn creates **udāsīntā** (indifference). In the 7th, that indifference to marriage is **especially detrimental** and brings an **inferiority complex** related to the spouse.

* **Meditation:** 7th = **dhyān**; Saturn = **vairāgya** → native is **meditative**; enjoys meditation greatly.

* **Politics (per text):** **Good for politics**—7th as *pad-prāpti/simhāsana*, Saturn as **karaka of the people (prajā)** (Moon = society; Sun = king; Saturn = people). Interest in **geopolitics, political scenarios, socialism, public issues**.
