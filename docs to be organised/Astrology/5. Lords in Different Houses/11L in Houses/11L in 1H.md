* When the **11th lord** is in the **1st house**, it is said that the person is **born in a good or rich family**.
* Such natives are **extremely fortunate** and **earn a lot of money and wealth**.
* Why? Because the **house of gain (11th)** connects directly with the **self (1st house)**.

---

**(00:25)**

* If the planet is **benefic**, it carries the **energy of Jupiter (Guru)**.
* Jupiter gains **Dikbala (directional strength)** in the 1st house, which makes this a **very good combination**.
* Hence, when the **lord of gains** sits in **Lagna**, it’s a **positive yoga** — Jupiter gives *ichha-poorti* (fulfillment of desires).
* Therefore, such natives are considered **extremely fortunate**.

---

**(01:06)**

* They **earn a lot of money** since the 11th house represents **gains**.
* If the **11th lord is exalted**, the person can be **born in a super-rich family**.

---

**(01:20)**

* The **11th house** also has representation from **Saturn** and **Rahu** (since both naturally signify gains, desires, and networks).
* If the **11th lord** comes to **Lagna** but is **malefic** (e.g., Saturn, Rahu, afflicted), it can cause **bad health**.
* Reason: Saturn becomes **marana karaka** in the Lagna (a weak position).

---

**(01:50)**

* Such placement can make a person **extremely money-centric** — or more precisely, **self-centric**.
* Why? Because the **lord of gain** is sitting **on one’s head (Lagna)** — meaning every thought revolves around personal benefit or profit.
* This can also make the person **mentally weak or dependent**, because they **cannot function without desire fulfillment**.

---

**(02:20)**

* “जो कर लिया वो सर पे बैठ गया” — Whatever desire or passion they pursue sits on their head completely.
* This indicates **strong attachment** to desires or achievements.
* So, while **benefic influence** gives fulfillment, **malefic influence** leads to restlessness, health issues, and obsession with gains.

---

**(02:45)**

* The **benefic influence** of this yoga is **very strong**:

  * The person’s desires are fulfilled in this birth itself.
  * Because **Jupiter has Dikbala** in Lagna, it grants wealth, luck, and overall prosperity.

**(03:00)**

* Generally, people who have **a lot of money** often show a **connection between 11th lord, 2nd lord, and Lagna lord**.
* For example, if **Mercury** is involved and sits in Lagna, it makes the native **intelligent** and **good with communication, finance, and family matters** (since Mercury also relates to intellect and trade).
* Mercury in Lagna gains **Dikbala**, hence strengthens the chart further.

---

**(03:20)**

* However, when **Mercury combines with Rahu**, it creates a special yoga called **Unmād Yoga**.
* “Unmād” literally means **over-obsession** or **mad passion** toward something.
* It’s the **opposite of depression** — rather than low energy, it’s **excessive excitement or obsession**.
* Rahu fuels the **fire of desire**, while **Mercury adds intelligence** — together, they cause **hyper-focus or obsessive behavior** toward goals or interests.

---

**(03:43)**

* Thus, the **Rahu–Mercury combination** in this placement amplifies passion and ambition — but can also create instability if not balanced.

---

**Summary Essence:**

* **11th lord in 1st house = “Ichha Poorti Yoga.”**
* Brings wealth, luck, fulfillment of desires, and social gains.
* **Benefic planets** → prosperity, noble desires, and recognition.
* **Malefic or afflicted** → health issues, greed, obsession, and self-centeredness.
* **Rahu–Mercury combo** → extreme passion and over-ambitious tendencies (Unmād Yoga).
