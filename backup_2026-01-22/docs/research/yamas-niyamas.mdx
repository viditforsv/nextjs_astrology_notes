# Yamas and Niyamas

The Yamas and Niyamas form the foundational ethical framework of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, representing the first two limbs of the eight-fold path of Yoga (Ashtanga Yoga | अष्टांग योग).

## The Five Yamas / पंच यम (Restraints)

### 1. Ahimsa / अहिंसा (Non-violence)
The practice of non-violence in thought, word, and action towards all living beings.

### 2. Satya / सत्य (Truthfulness)
Commitment to truthfulness in speech, thought, and action.

### 3. Asteya / अस्तेय (Non-stealing)
Abstaining from taking what is not freely given, including material possessions, ideas, and time.

### 4. Brahmacharya / ब्रह्मचर्य (Right use of energy)
Conservation and proper channeling of vital energy. Having a say over the five senses (पंचिंदियाँ) and the pleasure we try to derive from them. 

### 5. Aparigraha / अपरिग्रह (Non-possessiveness)
Freedom from greed and attachment to material possessions and outcomes.

## The Five Niyamas / पंच नियम (Observances)

### 1. Saucha / शौच (Purity)
Cleanliness of body, mind, and environment.

### 2. Santosha / संतोष (Contentment)
Finding contentment and peace with what one has.

### 3. Tapas / तप (Self-discipline)
Practicing self-discipline and austerity to purify the body and mind.

### 4. Svadhyaya / स्वाध्याय (Self-study)
Study of sacred texts and self-reflection for spiritual growth.

### 5. Ishvara Pranidhana / ईश्वर प्रणिधान (Surrender to the Divine)
Devotion and surrender to a higher power or universal consciousness.

## Connection to SPEIM Framework

Each of the five Yamas and five Niyamas corresponds to one of the five SPEIM dimensions, creating a complete ethical and practical framework for human development.

### The Mapping

| SPEIM Dimension | Yama (Restraint) | Niyama (Observance) |
|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Spiritual (S)** | Asteya | Ishvara Pranidhana |
| **Physical (P)** | Ahimsa | Saucha |
| **Emotional (E)** | Brahmacharya | Santosha |
| **Intellectual (I)** | Satya | Svadhyaya |
| **Material (M)** | Aparigraha | Tapas |

This mapping reveals how ancient wisdom provides both restraints (what to avoid) and observances (what to practice) for each dimension of human experience.

## Connection to Vedic Astrology

The Yamas and Niyamas provide the ethical framework through which planetary influences manifest in individual consciousness. Understanding these principles helps in:

- Interpreting planetary placements through an ethical lens
- Understanding behavioral patterns indicated by the birth chart
- Applying remedial measures that align with spiritual principles
- Analyzing compatibility based on shared values
