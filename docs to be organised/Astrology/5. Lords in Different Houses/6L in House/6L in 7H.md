### 6th Lord in 7th House — Notes

* 7th house = **12th from 6th** → when 6th lord sits here, it brings **loss and conflict** in marriage.
* Indicates **marital discord, separation, or divorce** tendencies.
* If **7th lord itself goes 12th**, spouse may move away;
  but when **6th lord enters 7th**, conflicts remain **within marriage** — constant friction.
* Despite marital issues, native may be **famous, honorable, virtuous, adventurous, and wealthy.**

**Planetary energy:**

* 6th house ruled by **Mars and Saturn energies**.
* When this energy moves to 7th:

  * **Mars** (maraṇa-kāraka here) → kills enemies, gives courage and boldness.
  * **Saturn** → *dighbali* (directional strength) in 7th, gives wealth through hard work.

**Health aspect:**

* 6th lord = house of disease; sitting in 7th → may cause **health issues for spouse**.

**Venereal / sensual aspect:**

* **Mercury** and **Saturn** linked to 7th can cause **venereal diseases or sexual irregularities**.
* Mercury’s dual, neutral nature → can show **duality in orientation** (homosexual/lesbian tendency) if reinforced in *Navamsha*.
* Mercury in Saturn/Mars signs in 7th can create this pattern.

**Overall effect:**

* Not good for marriage; spouse relations unstable or problematic.
* However, gives **courage, name, and recognition** through Saturnine endurance and Mars-like bravery.
* Brings a life of struggle in partnership but also success earned through those very struggles.
