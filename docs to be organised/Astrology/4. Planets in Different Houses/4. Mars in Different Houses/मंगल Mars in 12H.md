1. **General Nature**

   * 12th house = expenses, losses, foreign stay, jail, moksha.
   * Mars here is generally a **bad placement** since Mars is about action and power, not renunciation.

2. **Tendencies & Behavior**

   * Creates anger, jealousy, destructive impulses.
   * Native may indulge in wrong deeds, take what is not theirs, or misuse power.
   * Can indicate jail time if afflicted.

3. **If Well-Placed**

   * If exalted, in own sign, or aspected by benefics → transforms into generosity, sacrifice, spiritual pursuit.
   * Can make person a great giver (*dānavīr* like Karna), selfless, devoted, and inclined toward spirituality from an early age.

4. **Aspects**

   * On **6th house** → repeatedly creates and destroys enemies; fights become a pattern.
   * On **7th house** → creates problems for spouse, Manglik dosha, marital suffering.
   * On **3rd house** → drives constant effort (*parakram*), but often directed toward indulgence or desires (unless benefic aspect, then toward spiritual practice).

5. **Conflict Between Karma & Moksha**

   * 12th is moksha house, but Mars represents action and conquest.
   * Hence creates inner conflict: instead of renouncing, native clings and fights.
   * If spiritualized, Mars channels energy into asceticism, practice, or sacrifice; if not, into indulgence and conflict.
