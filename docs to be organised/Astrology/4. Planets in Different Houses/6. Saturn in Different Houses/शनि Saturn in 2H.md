**Saturn in the 2nd House**

* **House Significations:**

  * 2nd house = wealth, speech, family, lineage, savings.

* **Positive aspects:**

  * Saturn is significator (karaka) of the 8th house. When placed in the 2nd, it aspects the 8th (its own domain), strengthening it — a principle where a planet looking at its own signification increases it.
  * Can give significant wealth and property.
  * Source of earning will be Saturn-related fields (mining, underground work, etc.) or even gambling/lottery.

* **Challenges with wealth:**

  * Saturn is malefic, so money may face obstacles — can be “taken away by the king” (government interference/tax/penalty).
  * Saturn and Sun oppose each other: when one tries to give, the other obstructs.

* **Saturn’s nature (discipline & testing):**

  * Like a judge in court — demands discipline.
  * Wherever Saturn sits/aspects, discipline weakens there because Saturn’s role is to test and “punish” through challenges.
  * In 2nd house: person may be careless about money.

* **Family & relationships:**

  * Brings sorrow from family; creates distance from them, though longing remains.
  * Rahu in 2nd = rebellion against family; Saturn in 2nd = distance without rebellion.

* **If afflicted (malefic sign/enemy sign):**

  * May engage in theft of others’ wealth.
  * Eye problems possible.

* **Tamasik influence:**

  * Saturn is the most tamasik planet (then Rahu, Mars, Ketu).
  * Can incline toward alcohol, tobacco, non-vegetarian food.

* **Speech & behavior:**

  * Saturn governs lies and abusive language; in 2nd house may cause foul speech, lying, or chronic mouth-related diseases.
  * If in a friend’s sign, can give benefits; in enemy sign, more harmful tendencies.

* **Chronic results:**

  * Whatever Saturn gives (wealth, health issues) tends to be chronic — long-lasting.
  * Large fortunes in life are ultimately only by Saturn’s grace.
