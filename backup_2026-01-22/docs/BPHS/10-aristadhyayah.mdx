## Short-Life Combinations (Verses 3-8)

These verses describe combinations that indicate immediate defects for longevity. These yogas help detect potential issues early so that remedial measures (fire sacrifice, prayers, donations, medicine, etc.) can be taken to prevent untimely death (Akala Mrityu).

**Note:** While longevity cannot be definitively declared until the 24th year of age (as stated in Verse 2), these combinations are mentioned to identify immediate defects and guide individuals toward remedial measures. (See ch. 5 of Horasara for more information.)
