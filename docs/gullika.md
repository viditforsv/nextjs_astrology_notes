Gulika is basically Saturn’s "Evil Twin" (or technically, his son).

Think of him as a concentrated dose of bad luck or a "system glitch" in your chart.

1. The Myth (The "What")
Gulika is the severed leg of Saturn. Legend says Ravana tried to force all planets into the lucky 11th house for his son's birth. Saturn, being rebellious, stretched his leg into the unlucky 12th house. Ravana cut it off, and that piece became Gulika.



2. The Vibe (The "Nature")
He is an Upagraha (satellite/shadow point), not a physical planet.

Toxic: He poisons whatever house he sits in (except 3, 6, 11).

Slow: His name comes from Mand (slow/sluggish). He causes delays that feel irrational.
