✅ **Essence:**
Rahu in 2nd magnifies **speech, wealth, and family karma**. It makes the person **talkative, sharp, ambitious, and materialistic**, but also compulsive, deceptive, and rebellious if afflicted. Under Jupiter’s guidance, this Rahu can turn into **a diplomat, negotiator, or powerful speaker**; without it, it leads to **lies, addictions, and downfall in family/wealth matters**.
