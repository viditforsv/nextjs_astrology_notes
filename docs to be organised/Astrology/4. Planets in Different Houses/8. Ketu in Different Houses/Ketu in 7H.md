### 1. **Basic Nature of Placement**

* 7th house = marriage, spouse, partnerships (ruled by Venus).
* Ketu dislikes marriage → behaves like Mars (bachelor, detached).
* Considered a **challenging/bad placement** unless supported by benefics.
* 7th = *maraka* for Mars, and Ketu itself is “already dead,” so it brings detachment, deception, or unhappiness in marriage.

### 2. **Marriage & Relationship Impact**

* Creates **unhappy or troubled marriage** unless benefic aspect is present.
* Ketu in 7th = spouse-related difficulties:

  * deception in marriage
  * expectations vs reality mismatch
  * confusion in relationships (*“na chhoda jaye, na pakda jaye”*).
* Engagements/first marriage often break; sometimes leads to remarriage.
* Remedies like **Kumbh Vivah** (symbolic marriage to a pot/tree) are traditionally performed in such cases → symbolic way of neutralizing karmic blocks.

---

### 3. **Spouse & Adjustment**

* One must **bow before spouse** (submit/adjust) when Ketu is in 7th.
* Without benefic guidance, conflicts arise; with benefic influence, marriage sustains but with detachment.
* Spouse may not match expectations → some mismatch always exists.

---

### 4. **Health Indications**

* 7th house linked to lower abdomen/genitals → Ketu here can give:

  * diseases in reproductive organs
  * uterus issues, abdominal or genital cancers (if afflicted).

---

### 5. **Character & Morality**

* If combined with malefics → can make person **characterless** or morally questioned.
* Deception or hidden tendencies in marital/sexual matters may arise.

---

### 6. **Sign & Rashi Influence**

* If Ketu is in **Pisces (Meena)** (Jupiter’s sign):

  * Considered **good placement** (since Pisces is 12th house in Kalpurush = moksha sign).
  * Spiritual tendencies strengthen; not as damaging for marriage.
* Ketu’s own/favored sign = Scorpio (Vrischika), as it rules occult, tantra, spirituality.

---

### 7. **Common Errors in Prediction**

* Not all 7th house Ketu cases = broken marriage.
* Must also check:

  * Sign of placement (benefic or malefic)
  * Condition of 7th lord
  * Aspects from benefics (esp. Jupiter).
* If 7th lord is strong and Ketu is in benefic sign → marriage is not destroyed, though detachment/confusion persists.

---

### 8. **Traditional Remedy (Kumbh Vivah)**

* Performed especially for **Rahu/Ketu in 7th house**.
* Considered symbolic ritual → marrying a pot/tree before human marriage.
* Neutralizes negative karma, prevents marital suffering.
* Not superstition but symbolic representation → widely practiced (e.g., Aishwarya Rai before marriage).
