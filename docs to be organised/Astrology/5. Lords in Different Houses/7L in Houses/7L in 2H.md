## 🔹 Concept Summary
- The 7th Lord in the 2nd House moves **from a Kendra (7th)** to an **8th position from itself**, symbolizing tension.
- **If afflicted** → multiple marriages, loss, or death of spouse.
- **If benefic** → wealth and gains through marriage and spouse.
- Both 7th and 2nd houses have *Maraka (death-inflicting)* energy — so the period/dasha of these can bring critical events.
- The house represents **family, speech, wealth, and values**, so marriage directly affects these themes.
- Venus (the natural significator of the 7th) represents *attachment*; hence emotional or material clinging can cause suffering when afflicted.

## 🧭 Notes
- **Maraka Energy**: Since both 2H and 7H are maraka sthanas, dasha of 7L in 2H can activate health crises or karmic closures.  
- **Dual Signs Warning**: Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces amplify chances of multiple relationships.  
- **Wealth via Marriage**: A benefic 7L here can give spouse from wealthy lineage or business-oriented family.  
- **Affliction Theme**: Affliction converts attachment (Venus quality) into suffering — “moh becomes the source of pain.”
