1. **Basic Nature**

   * Ketu is **headless**, hence speech issues: stammering, unclear expression, bad speaker.
   * 2nd house = speech, family, savings → Ketu here distorts these areas.

2. **Speech & Expression**

   * Creates **stammering or disjointed speech**.
   * Words often come out without thought, sometimes harsh or negative.
   * Called *kali jubaan* (dark tongue) → what is spoken often manifests.
   * Many astrologers with Ketu in 2nd give predictions that, even if wrong, often manifest.
   * Negative production bahut acchi karta hai

3. **Wealth & Savings**

   * Can cause **loss of savings**, often through fraud, deception, or hidden issues.
   * If spiritual influence is strong, creates *vairagya* (detachment) from wealth.
   * Ketu in 2nd weakens attachment to wealth and family lineage.

4. **Family & Lineage**

   * If benefic → good spiritual values from family.
   * If afflicted → bad values, corrupted DNA/lineage tendencies.
   * Person becomes detached from family emotionally, even if living with them.

5. **Spiritual Path**

   * On spiritual path → very powerful, gives detachment from wealth and family distractions.
   * Can create vairagya that aids liberation.

6. **Negative Speech & Karma**

   * Negative predictions/words manifest strongly, hence dangerous karma if misused.
   * Especially risky if Ketu conjoins Mars → extremely dangerous combination → avoid negative predictions.

7. **Benefic Influence**

   * If aspected/combined with benefics (Jupiter, Mercury) → speech becomes **powerful, spiritual, positive**.
   * If afflicted by malefics (Mars, Rahu, Saturn) → speech becomes **harsh, negative, destructive**.

8. **Health Effects**

   * Almost always gives **eye problems** in life.
   * Creates mental disconnection between mind and speech.

9. **Overall Nature**

   * Dual outcome:

     * **Negative** → harsh speech, fraud, family detachment, loss of savings.
     * **Positive (with benefics)** → powerful mystical speech, spiritual detachment, capacity for deep insight.
