# Practical Remedies & Color Selection

## 4th House - Vehicles & Animals

### General Rules
- Cows, buffalo, pets = 4H significations
- Vehicle selection based on 4L and planets in/aspecting 4H

### Vehicle Colors

**Ideal (Universal):**
- **White** - Venus color, generally auspicious

**Avoid Based on Planetary Afflictions:**
- **8L in 4H (especially Saturn):** Avoid black, grey, blue
- Never buy second-hand vehicles with 8L affliction

**Risk Periods:**
- 6L dasha + (4L or Moon) antardasha = vehicle accidents
- Extra caution required

### Profession-Based Selection
- Profession-related colors (e.g., PM uses black for security/secrets)
- Personal chart takes priority over general rules

## Navamsha (D9) Remedies

### The "Final Gate" Rule

Navamsha is the final gate. If a planet is bad here, the result is blocked, regardless of the Birth Chart. Remedies become essential.

### 9th House Remedies (Guru/Dharma)

**Malefics in 9th House:**

Unlike the 5th house (where meditation works), malefics here *require* specific remedies because luck is outside your control.

| Planet | Remedy |
| --- | --- |
| <span className="hindi">शनि</span> (Saturn) | Worship Goddess Devi |
| <span className="hindi">राहु</span> (Rahu) | Worship Lord Vishnu |
| <span className="hindi">मंगल</span> (Mars) | Worship Rudra |

**Special Combinations:**

- **<span className="hindi">शनि</span> (Saturn) + <span className="hindi">गुरु</span> (Jupiter) in 9th:** Worship Devi (Sri Suktam)
- **<span className="hindi">सूर्य</span> (Sun) + <span className="hindi">राहु</span> (Rahu) in 9th (Pitra Dosh):**
  - **Symptoms:** Depression, insomnia, addiction (alcohol), lack of family growth
  - **Remedy:** Perform Pitra Dosh Puja/Tarpan/Havan during Pitra Paksha
  - **Important:** Repeat if results are not seen immediately

**Warning:**

If <span className="hindi">राहु</span> (Rahu)/<span className="hindi">मंगल</span> (Mars) are in the 9th, do not trust "magical" remedies or flashy Gurus; you are prone to deception.

### 10th House Remedies (Wealth/Artha)

**The Rule:** "He who gives will also take." Malefics give money but can strip it away suddenly (losses/medical bills).

**The Fix:** Voluntary donation. If you don't donate, the planet will take the money forcefully.

**Exception:** If the malefic is in its **Own Sign (Swaraashi)** or **Exalted**, it will *not* take the money away.

**10th House Malefics - Donation Remedies:**

If you have a malefic in the 10th (that is not exalted), you **must** donate to related causes *before* the dasha hits to avoid the planet taking your money by force.

| Planet | Donation Target |
| --- | --- |
| <span className="hindi">शनि</span> (Saturn) | Gareebo ko bhojan aur siksha (Food and education to the poor/laborers) |
| <span className="hindi">राहु</span> (Rahu) | Pitron, kodiyon, andhon ke liye donation (Ancestors, lepers, blind). Prisoners welfare. |
| <span className="hindi">केतु</span> (Ketu) | Machliyon ko daana, kutto ko biskul regular rakho (Feed fish, feed dogs regularly) |
| <span className="hindi">मंगल</span> (Mars) | Donate to Security Forces or PM Relief Fund. Pray to Hanuman ji |

**<span className="hindi">केतु</span> (Ketu) in 10th:**

- **Remedy:** Feed the poor or donate to avoid sudden losses

### <span className="hindi">शुक्र</span> (Venus) 12th Centric Remedies

If <span className="hindi">शुक्र</span> (Venus) is 12th centric:

- **1200 grams khand (raw sugar)** - donate
- **Safed mithai** - pede etc - donate
- **1200 grams dahi (curd)** - donate
- **Silk ka kapda (white)** - on Devi ka mandir, wapas nahi leke aana (donate white silk cloth at Devi temple, don't bring it back)

---

### <span className="hindi">राहु</span> (Rahu) Remedies

**General <span className="hindi">राहु</span> (Rahu) Remedies:**

- **Joote chappal** (Shoes/slippers) - donate
- **Lohe ki keelein** (Iron nails) - donate
- **Kaala tila** (Black sesame) - donate
- **Kaali mirch** (Black pepper) - donate
- **Bikhariyon ko aur gareebo ko daan karo** (Donate to beggars and poor)

**Important Notes:**

- **Patient ko touch kara ke koi bhi daan kar sakta hai** (You can donate anything by touching a patient)
- **<span className="hindi">राहु</span> (Rahu) kaal main karna** (Do it during Rahu kaal)

---

### General Navamsha Remedies

**Vargottama & Sthanottama <span className="hindi">चंद्र</span> (Moon) (4th House):**

- Excellent for healing; protection comes from the Divine Mother

**Remedy Timing:**

- **Paap graha ke upaay dasha se pehle karne hai taaki dasha main losses na ho** (Do remedies for malefic planets before the dasha starts to avoid losses during dasha)
