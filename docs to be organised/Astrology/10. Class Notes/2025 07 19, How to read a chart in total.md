# Principles
- acche log acchi jagah hone chaiye. Acche log = Acche ghar ke maalik
- Bure log buri jagah baithe to accha hai
- Acche sthan main hota hai, Mitr Rashi main hai, shubh graha hai dekha jaata hai shubh hota hai
- Bure sthan main hota hai, Shatru Rashi main hai, Paap graha hai dekha jaata hai to kharab hota hai
- House is Place eg: 1H is body, Lord is person, eg 1L is Person, Buddhi
- Insaan lord main hai , body in house
- 3L Drishti - ??
- 6L Drishti - Conflict
- 8L Drishti - Kashtha
- 12L Drishti - Loss
---

eg: good husband, world likes, me not likey
i.e. 7th house is good by 7L is from 6,8,12 from 1L 

# Process
- Drishti sambandh
- Yuti Sambandh(Conjunction)
- Karaka of the house 
- Step 1: Har graha ko, har ghar ke maalik ko, us graha ko lagn se dekhenge
- Step 2: us graha ko apne ghar se dekhenge
- Step 3: Usi graha ko lagnesh se bhi dekhenge(wo karke mujhe kaise lagta hai)
- Step 4: Apply step 1 - 3 in all cases
