# Degrees

Planetary degrees indicate the exact position of a planet within a sign and are crucial for determining planetary strength and timing.

---

## Overview

Degrees range from 0° to 30° within each sign. The degree position affects:

- Planetary strength (Shad Bala)
- Timing of events
- Planetary states (exaltation, debilitation)
- Combustion calculations
- Nakshatra placement

## Key Concepts

- **0° to 10°**: Early degrees - Beginning of sign
- **10° to 20°**: Middle degrees - Peak strength
- **20° to 30°**: Late degrees - End of sign

## Importance in Analysis

- Determines exact nakshatra placement
- Calculates combustion distance from Sun
- Affects planetary strength calculations
- Used in timing predictions (Dasha, Gochar)
