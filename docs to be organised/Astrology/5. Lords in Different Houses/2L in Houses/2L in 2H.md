1. **General Rule**

   * Any lord in its own house protects that house.
   * 2nd house tells us **where wealth will come from**.
   * If the 2nd lord itself is in 2nd house → we can identify the source of money (through Jupiter, Mercury, Venus, Saturn, etc.).

2. **On Malefics in 2nd House**

   * If the planet is malefic but **not afflicted by another malefic influence** → it won’t cause loss, savings will remain high.
   * Difference:

     * 12th house = expenses.
     * 2nd house = savings.
   * Savings come when intellect (lagna) is applied between income (11th) and expenses (12th).

3. **Results of 2nd Lord in 2nd House**

   * Native becomes wealthy, proud, and blessed with a good family.
   * Related things (family, sanskar, wealth, savings) will be strong.

4. **Example of Saturn in 2nd**

   * For Sagittarius ascendant, Saturn in 2nd in own sign → wealth through Saturn-related activities (HR, petroleum, etc.).
   * Saturn can give a lot of money, being also 11th lord of income.

5. **Marriage/Family Angle**

   * Any planet in 2nd is 8th from 7th.
   * If malefic → can disturb marriage, create family problems, even divorce.
   * The stronger the malefic, the stronger the opposition (family interference → marital trouble).
   * Example: Saturn in 2nd → problems in marriage due to family traditions, rigid old customs, interference.

6. **Observation on Education**

   * Malefic planets in 2nd often give **science/technical education**.
   * Reason: 2nd house is part of the 2–8 axis, and also:

     * 2nd = 10th from 5th (professional qualification after basic education).
   * So malefics in 2nd can show technical/professional knowledge that leads to earning.

7. **Final Note**

   * 2nd house planet shows **how you will earn money**.
   * Malefics in 2nd, if well-placed, give technical/professional paths of wealth.
