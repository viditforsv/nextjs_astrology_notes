# 7th Lord in 6th House

## 🔹 Concept Summary
- The 7th Lord (marriage, partnership, desire) entering the **6th House** (enemies, debts, disease, disputes) is an **inauspicious and conflict-prone** placement.  
- The **spouse’s health** is often weak, and the **native’s peace of mind suffers** due to quarrels, anger, or dissatisfaction in marriage.  
- This placement makes **the spouse an adversarial figure** at times — a source of karmic conflict rather than harmony.  
- If **Venus (karaka)** or **7L** is afflicted → risk of **divorce**, **multiple marriages**, or **constant tension**.  
- 2H is 2nd Marriage - 7L in 6H is 2H se 5th, i.e. more than one marriage after the first spouse leaves. 
- **Saturn** here brings long-term illness or chronic dissatisfaction, often accompanied by a tendency to criticize the spouse.  
- **6th from Lagna** and **12th from 7th** → shows loss or dissolution of marital happiness and separation tendencies.  
- If extremely afflicted, it indicates **divorce and remarriage** — the first spouse departs, and karmic balance resets through another union.

## 🧭 Notes
- **Afflicted = Divorce Potential:** 7L in 6H indicates high probability of separation, especially if Venus or 7L is weak.  
- **Spouse’s Health:** Chronic or recurring illness is common; the native’s anger or criticism worsens it.  
- **Divorce → Second Marriage Logic:** Because 6H is *12th from 7H*, it dissolves the first marriage; the next union activates from the 9th (second from 7th).  
- **Saturn’s Role:** Gives endurance but creates mental heaviness. Remedies include *Kali worship* and cultivating compassion.  
- **Rahu/Ketu Influence:** Illusions, betrayals, or hidden enemies in marriage; karmic cleansing through confrontation and acceptance.
