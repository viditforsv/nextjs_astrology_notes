Graha jaahan baitha hai to wo long lasting hoti hai, jahan drishti hoti hai wo aata jaata rehta hai. 

In Dasha - Very important ki planet is sitting in which nakshatra and its lord is sitting where and from which lordship. 

Dasha lord jis bhi sthan se 6,8, 12 baitha hai, uske negative results aaenge

for eg: Ra in my 5H will give negative results of 6H, 10H and 12H
but since it is in 5H then kuch accha bhi dega because trikone main baitha hai. Sthan ka quality bhi important hai. 

Lekin agar for eg: Sa in 3H, in Sa dasha - 4H, 8H, 10H ke negative results aaenge, and 3H ke bhi results aaenge 

Dasha lord ki placement se kendra trikona ke positive results aaenge
- for eg: Ra in 5H - 9H, 1H, 8H, 11H, 2H ke acche results aaenge. 

eg: Me in 1H, in Maha dasha, kanya lagn. Sa in 8H, then Me-Sa dasha will be problematic

2 things
6,8,12 houses from the maha dasha lord placement is bad
also the lords sitting 6,8,12 from this lord will not allow him to work. 
2H and 7H ke maarak ke result dega

10 dasha - Maarak to both mother and father. 

10H ke baithak ki dasha main mother father ki death hoti hai
8H ke graha ki dasha main 7H se 2nd ho gaya and 2H se 7th ho gaya. To 7H and 2H ke marak ke result aate hain, is time pe spouse ka death hota hai.
