# The Sacred Connection: SPEIM Framework and Yamas-Niyamas

This page explores the profound connection between the SPEIM framework and the ethical foundations of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras - the Yamas and Niyamas.

## The Fundamental Mapping

| **SPEIM** | **Yama (Restraint)** | **Niyama (Observance)** | Pandavas |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|----------|
| **S – Spiritual** | Asteya (Non-stealing) | Ishvara Pranidhana (Surrender) | Yudhishthir |
| **P – Physical** | Ahimsa (Non-violence) | Saucha (Purity/Cleanliness) | Bhima |
| **E – Emotional** | Brahmacharya (Moderation) | Santosha (Contentment) | Arjun |
| **I – Intellectual** | Satya (Truthfulness) | Svadhyaya (Self-study) | Sahadev |
| **M – Material** | Aparigraha (Non-hoarding) | Tapas (Discipline/Austerity) | Nakul |

## The Fundamental Parallel
