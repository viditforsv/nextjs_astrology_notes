## Special Notes

Jyeshtha is a complex and powerful nakshatra. The earring or circular amulet represents protection and authority. The umbrella symbolizes protection offered to others.

This nakshatra is challenging because it brings:
- Great power with great responsibility
- Leadership that can become burdensome
- Tendency to bear others' problems
- Need to balance pride with humility

Jyeshtha is NOT generally considered auspicious for:
- Starting new ventures
- Marriages
- Beginning education
- Peaceful activities

However, it IS good for:
- Protective rituals
- Dealing with enemies
- Military operations
- Taking charge in emergencies

People born under Jyeshtha often experience a "fall before rise" pattern - they may face significant challenges early in life but eventually rise to positions of authority and respect. The key lesson is to use power wisely and without arrogance.
