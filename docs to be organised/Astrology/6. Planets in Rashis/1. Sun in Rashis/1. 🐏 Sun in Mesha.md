## 🌞 **Sun in Aries (Meṣa Rāśi)**

* Sun is **exalted (Uccha)** in Aries (at 10°).
* This gives strength, clarity, leadership, courage, and radiance.
* It represents the **Atman** (soul), ego, authority, father, and dharma.

Now let’s read it **through PISEM**:

---

### **P – Physical (Ahimsa / Shaucha)**

* **Sun in Aries** → a fiery, energetic body, strong vitality.
* Risk: excess aggression, dominating presence (opposite of Ahimsa).
* Remedy: practice *Shaucha* (purity of body + lifestyle), channel vitality through disciplined routines and clean habits.

---

### **I – Intellectual (Satya / Swadhyaya)**

* Sun in Aries gives **clarity of vision, decisive thinking**.
* Risk: overconfidence in one’s own truth, intellectual arrogance.
* Remedy: *Swadhyaya* (self-study, humility through scriptures) keeps the ego in check, aligns Satya (truth) with higher dharma.

---

### **S – Spiritual (Asteya / Ishwar Pranidhana)**

* Exalted Sun has a natural **spiritual radiance** — desire to guide, inspire, and stand in dharma.
* Risk: stealing the spotlight (Asteya violation), claiming divine authority personally.
* Remedy: *Ishwar Pranidhana* (surrender to Divine) — channel authority as service, not possession.

---

### **E – Emotional (Brahmacharya / Santosha)**

* Aries Sun is passionate, fiery in emotions. Quick to anger or assert.
* Risk: indulgence in ego-driven desires, restlessness.
* Remedy: *Brahmacharya* (emotional moderation), and *Santosha* (contentment) bring balance — learn to lead without domination.

---

### **M – Material (Aparigraha / Tapas)**

* Exalted Sun blesses with **authority, recognition, high positions** in the material world.
* Risk: hoarding status, craving control (Aparigraha violation).
* Remedy: *Tapas* (discipline, austerity) ensures energy is used for purpose, not pride.
