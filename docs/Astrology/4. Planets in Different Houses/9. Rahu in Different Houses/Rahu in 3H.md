# 🌑 Rahu in the 3rd House – Parakram, Courage, and Adventure

* Malefics (Rahu, Ketu, Mars, Saturn) generally do well in **3, 6, 11**.
* Rahu in 3rd is considered **a strong, adventurous, and rising placement**.

### 2. **Position in Family**

* Often the native is **eldest or youngest in their gender line**.
* Rahu in 3rd tends to **collapse younger same-gender sibling** (either absence, loss, or disconnection).

✅ **Essence:**
Rahu in 3rd makes the native **fearless, adventurous, and boundary-breaking**. It is one of the stronger placements of Rahu, often giving **political power, daring achievements, or internet/software success**. But it disturbs sibling harmony and can create **restless, risk-obsessed tendencies** if not balanced. Proper channeling into sports/adventure is essential.
