 **Summary – Mercury in the 1st House (Transcript Only)**

* **Directional strength (Digbala)**:

  * Mercury gets digbala in the 1st house (*lagna*).
  * Mercury’s direction is North and North-East (shared with Jupiter).
  * When Mercury is in *lagna*, it gains special power — like getting a power boost in a game.
  * This is considered one of the **best placements** for Mercury if it is **not afflicted**.

* **If well-placed**:

  * Mercury is the significator of intellect → makes the person **very intelligent**.
  * Governs acting and humor → natives have a **good sense of humor**; comedians often have Mercury in *lagna* or its aspect there.
  * Being in the *lagna* (seat of intellect), it gives **business skills** and the ability to run businesses without emotional influence.
  * Prosperity and fame increase, especially if the person runs life in Mercury’s direction.
  * If in own sign (*swa-rashi*), it creates **Rajyoga** → excellent intelligence, potential to be a good mathematician.
  * Gives capacity to decide what information to retain or discard — natives tend to live in the present moment.
  * Gives **beautiful eyes**; strong eye-to-eye communication skills that can persuade others easily.
  * Excellent for **acting** — they can control expressions, revealing only what they want others to see.
  * If Moon is strong, emotions remain under control; person is ruled by intellect.
  * With good placement (directional strength, friendly sign), most life problems are overcome because **high awareness removes sorrow**; they can sail through even big incidents smoothly.

* **If afflicted**:

  * Afflicted Mercury in *lagna* can **ruin a person** — intelligence turns into “wrong intellect” (*kubuddhi*).
  * The person may become their own worst enemy by refusing advice and staying stuck in dangerous mental zones.
  * Especially in a **male chart**, if Mercury in *lagna* has malefic aspects, it can make the native **characterless**.

* **Other traits**:

  * Acts as a planet of intellect — others may perceive them as emotionless since they operate mainly through logic.
  * Natural actors — it is hard for others to know what’s going on inside; they only show the expressions they choose.
