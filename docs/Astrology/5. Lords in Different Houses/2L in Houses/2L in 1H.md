1. **Nature of 2nd House**

   * 2nd house has two opposite-nature planets as general karakas: **Venus** (Lakshmi, natural maraka, wealth, business) and **Jupiter** (karaka of family, wealth, fortune, karma).
   * Hence, the 2nd house is a very important place, carrying both good and bad results.

2. **When 2nd Lord goes to 1st House**

   * Any house lord sitting in lagna affects intellect; lagna is influenced.
   * If strong → person gains wealth from own effort/intellect.
   * If weak (debilitated, combust, etc.) → more expenses, wealth wasted.

3. **Family Aspect**

   * 2nd house is family. When its lord sits in lagna → person is family-focused.
   * If benefic → person becomes dear to family, works for family.
   * If malefic → person rebels against family, feels wronged by them.

4. **Wealth and Savings**

   * 2nd lord in lagna gives focus on savings (not gains like 11th lord).
   * Strong placement → strong saving orientation, wealth-conscious, makes person truly rich.
   * The “money sits on the head” (intellect is focused on wealth).

5. **General Rule of Kendras**

   * Any planet (other than 6th, 8th and 12th lords) in a kendra manifests good results. #generalPrinciple 
   * Hence, 2nd lord in 1st (a kendra) is generally good.

6. **Classical Reference**

   * Texts say: 2nd lord in lagna → native will have son and wealth.
   * But may also become inimical to family, lustful, hard-hearted, and serve others’ jobs if the planet is malefic.

7. **Lust and 7th House Connection**

   * 2nd house is 8th from 7th (house of sex).
   * If Venus (often the 2nd lord) is in lagna and looks at 7th, with malefic influence → person becomes lustful.
   * If tainted, makes one hard-hearted, cruel.

8. **Hard-heartedness Explanation**

   * Hard-heartedness (निर्दयी) comes from life experiences.
   * If both Jupiter and Venus (karakas of intellect) are weak/afflicted → intellect becomes harsh, cruel, insensitive.

9. **Family Focus – Positive vs Negative**

   * Even if negative, the focus remains on family:

     * Positive focus → love, support, care.
     * Negative focus → rebellion, conflict, feeling of betrayal.

10. **Planet + Influence Examples**

    * If 2nd lord Saturn sits in lagna with Mars → rebellion due to violence in family.
    * If Saturn with Rahu → rebellion due to deceit experienced in family.
    * Thus, predictions depend on which planet influences.

11. **Final Judgement**

    * **Without malefic influence** → superb placement: wealthy, strong family orientation, good spouse happiness, everything favorable.
    * **With malefic influence** → problems: wealth won’t sustain, expenses rise, money-obsessed mind, wrongdoings for money, family conflicts, lustful tendencies.
