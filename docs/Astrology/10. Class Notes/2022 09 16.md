## 🌕 Class Notes (Chronological Summary)

### 🪐 Exchange and Vargottama Saturn

* Example: Saturn is **Vargottama**, placed in the **12th house in Leo (Simha)** in both D1 and D9.

* The **Sun** is in the **5th house (Aquarius in Navamsha)** — **Saturn’s sign**, creating an **exchange (Parivartana Yoga)**.

* Question: How to interpret this exchange?

  → **When 5th lord exchanges with 12th lord**, or **5th lord sits in the 12th**, the **first child tends to go abroad** or have foreign connection.
  → The event may already have started — “The first child’s business or journey begins abroad.”

* Being **Vargottama**, Saturn’s quality is enhanced — it strengthens health, stability, and resilience.
  Even if an exchange occurs, the **Vargottama power remains intact**.
  Exchange only defines **interaction**, not **cancellation** of its inherent strength.

### ☀️ 6th Lord Sun in Lagna – Pisces Lagna Case

* **Pisces Ascendant (Meena Lagna)** → 6th lord is **Sun (Surya)** sitting in Lagna.
  In Navamsha, **Leo (Simha)** sign again appears, and Sun is in **8th house (again Pisces)**.

* Concern: Should one **avoid chanting or worship of 6/8/12 lords**?
	→ **No.**
  **Sun and Moon** never become malefic, even as lords of 6th, 8th, or 12th. #specialprincipal 
  Because they represent **Father (Sun)** and **Mother (Moon)** — the two creators of life.
  Hence, **their worship is always auspicious**.

* Principle:
  “Surya and Chandra do not carry 6th, 8th, or 12th dosha.”
  → They are exceptions to the general rule.

---

### 🪔 Case: Sagittarius Lagna – Venus Dasha Concerns

* Chart: **Sagittarius Lagna (Dhanu Lagna)**

  * **Guru (Jupiter)** in **6th house**,
  * **Shani (Saturn)** in **8th**,
  * **Venus** in **12th**.

* Running Dasha: **Guru–Shukra**, next subperiod **Guru–Shani** approaching.

* Remedy Advice:

  * Perform **Mahamrityunjaya Japa** (1.25 lakh chants) *only if financially possible*.
  * Otherwise, follow a **precautionary** approach.
  * **Drive less** during this period.
  * **Durga Saptashati Patha** is better than Mahamrityunjaya now due to Venus in 12th (Vipreet Raj Yoga).

* Observation:

  * **Jupiter Dasha** itself is beneficial (Lagnesh in 6th is manageable).
  * **Venus Dasha** brings **skin and eye issues**.
  * **Remedy:** Durga Saptashati recitation via priest during **Navratri** is ideal.

* Note:
  Guru being in **own sign in transit** will protect.
  “Don’t fear. Perform remedies and stay calm.”

### 🧿 Discussion on Marriage Matching and Love Marriage Charts

* **Case of love marriage with mismatched charts**:

  * Girl: **Uchcha Shani (exalted Saturn)** in 9th (Libra), leading to **strong fixation/obsession** (“Once she chooses, she won’t change”).
  * Boy: **Rahu in 7th**, **Saturn aspecting**, **Ketu in Lagna**, **7th Rahu in own sign**.

* Astrological Analysis:

  * **Mangal Dosh mismatch** (girl Manglik, boy not).
  * Such cases → **Avoid in arranged marriage.**
  * In **love marriage**, astrologer should not block it but **warn** about karmic lessons and suffering.
  * If both insist, **astrologer must stay neutral**; avoid giving “approval” stamp.

* Ethical Instruction for Astrologers:

  * **Do not take responsibility** for their marriage outcome.
  * When couples are emotionally charged, they seek validation — avoid giving direct consent.
  * If prediction must be given, be **gentle, vague, and ethical**.
    Example: “I am new / still learning / can’t clearly say.”

* **Don’t predict gender of unborn child.**
  Such acts can cause harm and karmic consequences.

---

### 🪙 Compatibility & Tara / Trikona Matching

* The teacher mentions **Kama Trikona** and **Moksha Trikona** matching via **Navatara system**.
* To be taught later — deferred explanation.

---

### 🌙 Sun–Moon Together in Navamsha

* If **Sun and Moon** are together in **2nd house of Navamsha**, especially when **Sun is 9th lord**, it indicates:

  * Frequent **parental conflicts** (between mother and father).
  * However, when **Sun combusts Moon**, the **conflict reduces** or becomes one-sided.

* **General Rule:**
  “Sun + Moon conjunction in Navamsha often reflects disputes between parents.”

---

### ♊ Mercury in 12th House – Combust & Retrograde

* Case: Mercury **in 12th**, **retrograde**, **combust**, **aspected by Saturn and Rahu**.
  → Such Mercury is “completely afflicted”.

* Psychological Result:

  * Mild depression, anxiety, overthinking.
  * Not deep depression, but nervous weakness.

* Remedies:

  1. Chant **“Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya”** (12-syllable Vishnu mantra).
  2. Chant **“Om Krim Kalika Namah”** (for Kali energy and courage).

  * Both balance afflicted Mercury and Moon.

---

### 🕉️ Retrograde Saturn and Exchange with Jupiter

* Case: **Saturn retrograde in 3rd**, **Jupiter in Saturn’s sign**, forming **exchange (Parivartana)**.
  → Good exchange.
  → But since **Saturn aspects Moon and Mercury**, mental heaviness persists.

* **Again, remedy:** “Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya”.

---

### ☀️ Exalted Venus – Malavya Yoga (Taurus Lagna)

* Example: **Taurus Lagna**, Venus **Swagrahi (own sign)** in Lagna,
  Aspected by **Mars (4th drishti)** and **Jupiter (7th drishti)** (retrograde in 6th).

* **Malavya Yoga confirmed.**

  * Venus strengthened by Jupiter — its **Uchcha Nath (lord of exaltation)**.
  * Excellent for charm, wealth, luxury, and grace.
  * But advised **not to overindulge** in comfort — “Even gods must let others enjoy happiness.”

* Child’s chart shows:

  * **10th Mars**, **Lagna Venus**, **7th Jupiter** → **strong career success.**
  * **Marriage triggers career rise** (7th lord’s link to 10th). #generalPrinciple 

---

### 💡 Lifestyle Questions (Light, Food)

* **Case: Sun in 8th (own sign, Leo) with Venus and Mercury.**

  * Prefers **yellow light** → not ideal. - it is not a good light #generalPrinciple 
  * Should use **white light** for balance.
  * “Yellow light disturbs 8th house Sun natives.”

* **Preference for boiled/sattvic food:**

  * Linked to **2nd lord Saturn** in **12th**, **aspected by Mars**.
  * Saturn induces **Tapas (austerity)** in food habits — disinterest in taste. #generalPrinciple 
  * Mars’ aspect gives **boiled, fire-cooked** inclination, but **avoids spicy food.**
  * People with **Mars in 6th, 8th, or 2nd** cannot digest spicy food well.

---

### 💢 Emotional Disturbance Case

* Chart: Capricorn Lagna

  * **Moon in 5th**, aspected by **Sun** and **Saturn (3rd)**,
  * **Rahu in 8th**, **Mercury combust + retrograde in 12th**.

* Outcome:

  * Mental fluctuation and mild depression.
  * **Reason:** Moon + Mercury both afflicted by Saturn and Rahu.

* Remedies repeated:

  * **Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya** (Mercury–Moon balance)
  * **Om Krim Kalika Namah** (strengthens inner will).

---

### 💫 10th Lord in 11th – Combust Query

* Even if **10th lord (Dashamesh)** in 11th is **combust**, the yoga still gives good results.
* **Combustion reduces strength**, but does **not nullify the auspicious yoga**.
* “The effect reduces in intensity, not quality.”

## 🧒 Case Study: 7-Year-Old Child – Leg Pain & Surgery Indication

**Context:**
A 7-year-old girl was experiencing pain in her leg for about a month.
Initially thought to be a fracture, but later doctors suspected a **bacterial infection**, possibly requiring **surgery**.

---

### 🪐 Chart Details

* **Ascendant (Lagna):** Aries (Mesha)
* **Sun (Surya):** 11th house – Aquarius (Kumbha)
* **Saturn (Shani):** 8th house
* **Rahu:** 6th house
* **Dasha sequence:** Sun → Saturn → Rahu

---

### 🩺 Teacher’s Diagnosis (Astrological Logic)

* **Mars** (ruler of Aries) **aspects Rahu** in the 6th house → **strong surgical indication**.
* 6th house governs **disease, injury, surgery, infection**.
* Aries Lagna means the **6th house falls in Virgo (Kanya)**, a **mutable earthy sign** ruled by **Mercury**, associated with **bacterial/nerve issues**.
* With **Rahu in the 6th** and **Mars’ aspect**, this combination can lead to:

  * **Bacterial infections**
  * **Abscess or internal inflammation**
  * **Minor surgery** (often around **lower abdomen or limbs**)

---

### 🧭 Teacher’s Assessment

> “Surgery is possible. The lower abdomen and leg region are affected because Mars aspects Rahu.
> For Aries Lagna, Virgo (6th) represents such regions — so yes, surgery is likely.”

---

### 🕉️ Remedies Recommended

* Perform **Rahu Shanti** (propitiation for Rahu).
* Perform **Mangal Shanti** (propitiation for Mars).
* Both should be **done together** for calming the dosha and preventing complications.
  → “Do Rahu Japa and Mangal Japa; it will settle the chart’s agitation.”

## 👩‍🦰 Case Study: 24-Year-Old Girl – Anger & Mild Depression

### 🪐 Chart Overview

* **Lagna:** Capricorn (Makara)
* **Planets in Lagna:**

  * **Mars (Mangala)**
  * **Jupiter (Guru)**
  * **Venus (Shukra)**
* **Moon (Chandra):** 5th house
* **Saturn (Shani):** 3rd house (retrograde)
* **Rahu:** 8th house
* **Mercury (Budha):** 12th house — combust and retrograde
* **Sun:** 11th house

---

### 🔍 Teacher’s Interpretation

1. **Ruchaka Yoga (Mars in Lagna):**

   * Mars in Capricorn (its exaltation sign) creates **Ruchaka Mahapurusha Yoga**.
   * Confers leadership, courage, initiative, and a strong personality.
   * However, when joined with **Jupiter** and **Venus**, the fiery nature can create **anger issues** and emotional volatility.

2. **Jupiter + Mars in Lagna:**

   * Jupiter’s wisdom and Mars’s energy produce great strength and willpower.
   * But here, Mars becomes **lord of 4th and 11th** and aspects Jupiter — leading to internal conflict between **emotion (Jupiter)** and **aggression (Mars)**.
   * The combination gives a **strong Rajayoga** but also **ego clashes**.

3. **Venus in Lagna:**

   * As a **yogakāraka** for Capricorn Lagna (ruling 5th and 10th), Venus forms **powerful Rajayoga** with Mars and Jupiter.
   * Results: beauty, charm, leadership potential, fame.

4. **Emotional / Mental Health Indicators:**

   * **Moon in 5th**, aspected by **Saturn from 3rd** → leads to emotional heaviness, worry, and mental overthinking.
   * **Rahu in 8th** adds hidden fears, anxiety, and obsessive thinking.
   * **Mercury** (planet of nerves and thoughts) is **combust + retrograde + 12th house** → causes mental confusion, nervousness, and mild depression.

---

### 🧘‍♀️ Teacher’s Observation

> “There’s not deep depression, just mild depression and mood swings.
> Mercury and Moon are both afflicted — Saturn aspects Moon, Rahu aspects Mercury.
> Hence mild psychological disturbance, not a clinical issue.”

---

### 🕉️ Remedies Prescribed

1. **For Mercury & Mind Calmness:**

   * Chant **“Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya”** daily (12-syllable Vishnu mantra).
   * Especially suitable when Mercury is in 12th, combust, or afflicted.

2. **For Courage & Strength:**

   * Chant **“Om Krim Kalika Namah”** (for Goddess Kali).
   * Restores mental stamina and removes fear.

3. **Lifestyle:**

   * Avoid over-thinking, meditate regularly, and keep mental rest cycles balanced.

> Add *Om Krim Kalika Namah* for confidence and grounding.”

# Yogas

### 🔯 Shubha Kartari & Paapa Kartari Yogas

* **Definition:**

  * If **Lagna** is flanked on both sides by **benefics → Shubha Kartari Yoga**
  * If **Lagna** is flanked by **malefics → Paapa Kartari Yoga**

* **Interpretation:**

  * *Shubha Kartari* → Two divine guards protect the native; luck, support, and positivity.
  * *Paapa Kartari* → Two bandits trap the native; health issues, losses, anxiety.

* **Cancellation:**

  * If a benefic sits in Lagna, even with malefics on both sides → *Paapa Kartari Bhanga* (cancelled).

---

### 🏵️ Amala Kirti Yoga

* **Definition:**
  From **Moon**, if **benefic planets** occupy the **10th house**, it forms **Amala Kirti Yoga**.

* **Meaning:**

  * “Amala” = pure, spotless; “Kirti” = fame.
  * Brings **fame, respect, and social reputation**.

* **Classical Definition (Parashara):**

  > “Rajya poojyo, mahabhogi, data, bandhujan priya, paropakari, dharmatma, punya kirti.”
  > i.e., Honored by rulers, prosperous, charitable, friendly, helpful, and virtuous.

* **Modern Interpretation:**

  * Seen primarily from **Moon**, but can also be considered from **Lagna**.
  * The planet in **10th from Moon** indicates:

    * **Profession**,
    * **Public perception**,
    * **Reputation.**

  Because:

  * Moon represents **the mind (internal inclination)** and **the public (external perception)**.
  * Therefore, the **10th from Moon** shows what the person *feels meant to do* and what society *recognizes them for.*

# Amala Kirti & the 10th from Moon (41:20–46:40)

* If **no planet** sits **10th from the Moon**, fame/profession is weak; if a planet sits there, its **power is decisive**.
* If a **benefic** sits **10th from the Moon**, the public perceives you **through that benefic**:

  * **Sun** (though generally not a benefic): if Sun is 10th from Moon → **state’s grace/favor**.
  * **Jupiter** 10th from Moon → do **excellently in teaching**.
  * **Venus** 10th from Moon → fame through **Venusian fields**; depending on sign, this could be **clothing/jewelry business**, **dance**, **painting**, **singing**, etc.
* Even a **malefic** 10th from Moon can give **fame**, but for **wrong/odd reasons** (examples cited: KRK, “Dhinchak Pooja”).
* Benefics 10th from Moon tend to produce **great wealth and honor**: mind stays pure, generosity rises when money flows easily.
* **Rahu–Ketu** generally **not used** for this yoga here (they’ll be covered under wealth/raja yogas later).
* If **2–3 planets** occupy the 10th from Moon, judge **the strongest**:

  * Strong = **own sign**, **exalted**, or **friend sign**.
  * Weak = **enemy sign** or **debilitated**.
* You can also check **10th from Lagna** (distinct idea):

  * Example shared: **Rahu + Moon** 10th from **Lagna** → very strong **planning/strategy** mind (“can build a plan in minutes”).
  * **Jupiter** 10th from **Moon** → heart is in **teaching**; doing that puts one “in trance” because **mind aligns with work**.
* **Bottom line:** If you do the **work indicated** by the planet **10th from Moon**, you naturally give **100%** and attain **success**.
* Malefics 10th from Moon give fame for **tough/negative traits**, **unless** they are **own/exalted**—then they can also act **auspiciously**:

  * **Saturn** 10th from Moon → people see you as **hard-working**; heavy work lands on your desk. If Saturn is **exalted/own**, people also see you as **truthful, disciplined, committed**.
  * A malefic can also create **negative fame** (e.g., known for **laziness**), illustrating “fame for the wrong reason.”
* This is a **variant** yoga used later under **employment/career** analysis: generally, **do** what sits **10th from Moon**.

---

# Parvata Yoga — Definitions, Conditions, Effects (47:18–58:25)

**Core principle:** Two alternative ways (English “OR”) to form **Parvata Yoga**:

1. **Either** **7th** or **8th** house has **no planet**, **or** if present there, it is **only benefic(s)**.
2. OR All benefics in kendra

   * (Why not the 6th? Because **malefics can be effective in 6th** specifically for overcoming obstacles, hence 6th is excluded from this clean benefic rule.)

**Results (classical phala given):**

* **Fortunate**, **eloquent** (gift of speech), **charitable**, **learned in shastra**, **fond of mirth/humor**, **famous**, **splendorous/majestic**, **radiant/tejasvi**, rises like a **leader**.

**Reasoning model (body-map of guṇas):**

* **Top/upper** (Lagna, 12th, 2nd… the “head/upper” region) → **Sattva/Rajas** zone.
* **Lower** (6th/7th/8th) → **Tamas** zone / **legs**.
* **Why benefics in kendras are great:** they seat **sattva/rajas** at the **heart/core**.
* **Why malefics in 6/7/8 are bad:** malefics crave **activity/energy**; in the **tamas zone** they **amplify inertia/struggle** (“running around, sandals wear out”).
* **Malefics at the head (Lagna/2nd/12th)** are also **not good** (anger from Mars, restless desires from Rahu, sorrow from Saturn).

  * Exception reiterated repeatedly: **own/exalted** malefic is **good**.
* If benefics go to the **lower** (6/7/8), they **sweep/clean** the negativity with their **sattva/rajas**.
* **Practical read:**

  * Check 6/7/8: if **malefics** sit there, life shows **heavy inertia/effort**; if **benefics**, the lower tamas is **cleaned**.
  * **Moon vs Lagna** lens:

    * From **Moon** (mind): malefics in 6/7/8 → **psychosomatic**, “mind pulled down.”
    * From **Lagna** (body): malefics in 6/7/8 → **physical issues**.
    * Malefics in **2/12 from Lagna** also **physically draining**; in **2/12 from Moon**, **mentally draining**.
* **Repeat/clarity notes given live:**

  * Don’t keep asking “what if exalted/own?” — **exalted/own is good**.
  * **Kendra = Vishnu-sthana** (heart); **only benefics in kendras** → you’re “already a king,” energy flows **upwards**.
  * **Malefics in 6/7/8** pull you **downwards like a crab**, towards **Muladhara/tamas**.

---

# Kahala (Kahal) Yoga — Conditions (59:05–end)

> “Conditions must be met **exactly**; no ‘jugaad’. Either the yoga **exists** or it **doesn’t**.”

**Fixed Condition #1 (mandatory):**

* **Lagnesh must be strong.**

  * Strong = well-placed: **in kendra** or **trikona** or **11th**, ideally **own/exalted/friend sign**.

**Condition #2 (choose **any one** of the following):**

* **(2A)** **4th lord** and **Jupiter** are in **mutual kendras** (*paraspara kendra*).

  * Example frames given: if **Jupiter in Lagna**, **4th lord** in **4th**; if **Jupiter in 7th**, **4th lord** in **1/4/7/10**, etc.
  * The essence: **4th lord** should be **in a kendra from Jupiter** (and vice-versa by being in kendras).
    **OR**
* **(2B)** **4th lord** and **10th lord** are **together** (**conjunct**) **in own or exaltation signs**.

  * Both together; at least **one of the two** should be **own/exalted** (“both at once is difficult; at least one suffices”).

**Thus:**

* **Condition #1 is compulsory**, plus **any one** path of **Condition #2** → **Kahala/Kahal Yoga** formed.

---

## Micro-recaps embedded in this segment

* **Amala Kirti (variant use):** 10th from **Moon** shows **what work the mind loves** and **public recognizes**; doing that gives **natural success**.
* **Malefics 10th from Moon:** give fame for **hard/negative themes** unless **own/exalted**, then they **uplift**.
* **Parvata Yoga:** **OR** rule — (7th/8th empty or only benefics) **OR** (only benefics in kendras). Clear effects listed.
* **Caution:** **6th** excluded from the “only benefics in kendras” rule because **malefics can work well** in 6th (through fighting obstacles).
* **Kahala Yoga:** **Lagnesh strong** (fixed) **+** either (4th lord ↔ Jupiter in mutual kendras) **or** (4th & 10th lords conjoined in own/exalt, at least one strong).

# Kahala (Kahal) Yoga — Effects & Interpretation 

* Results stated: the native is **strong (bali)**, **brave (sahasi)**, **dhūrt (shāna/clever)**, sometimes a **village/area chief**.
* Text term: **“Grāma-nāthaḥ”** (“lord of a village”). Two interpretations:

  1. **Land/property** side: with **Jupiter related to the 4th lord in a kendra**, one can gain **many properties/lands** (like a landlord).
  2. **Administrative/political** side: could become a **legislator/collector/mayor** (“owner/chief” of an area).
* Method: **Lift a word from śāstra → derive principle**:

  * “4th lord in kendra from Jupiter” → **property gain**.
  * Same combo can **give political/administrative roles**.
* Note: For **Dhanu/Mīna** etc., **Jupiter** itself often lands in kendras from Lagna/Moon—thus **Kahala** can form naturally there.

# Chāmara (Chāmar) Yoga — Definition & Results 

**Two ways to form it:**

1. **Lagnesh exalted in a kendra**, **aspected by Jupiter**.
2. **Benefics** positioned among **Lagna/9th/10th/7th** (teacher’s emphasis: **benefic in Lagna and/or 9th** is important; **Venus** in **7th/10th** also supports).

**Phala (as given):**

* Becomes **king** or **honored by the state** (rāj-pūjya), **long-lived (dīrghāyu)**, **learned/pandita**, **skilled in all arts**, and attended with **chāmara** (royal honor).

**Jupiter’s refrain across texts:** Wherever Jupiter features, **state’s grace**/recognition appears (higher officer, leader, etc.).

---

# Why This Works (Movable/Kendra logic) 

* **Lagnesh exalted in kendra** → extremely strong, **operational** (kendras are action centers).
* In the **Kālapuruṣa** scheme, all **4 kendras are movable signs**: planets there **move/grow/act**.
* **Trines (5th/9th)** reflect **past merit/demerit**—less mutable.
* If such a strong kendra Lagnesh is **aspected by Jupiter**, it **lifts you to the top** and brings **king/CEO/boss favor** (“state’s grace”).

---

# To Actually Experience Any Yoga: Strengthen Lagna & Moon

* **Parāśara**: **Yogas from the Moon** **give results first**; always **check from Moon**.
* If **Moon is afflicted**, even great rāja/wealth yogas feel **empty/unhappy**.
* Likewise, if **Lagnesh** (body/intellect) is **weak**, **yogas fail to be lived**.
* **Practical sādhanā**:

  * For **Lagna/Sūrya** (karaka of Lagna): **Gāyatrī** or **“Om Namaḥ Śivāya.”**
  * For **Moon** (mind): **Only Śiva-upāsanā & dhyāna.**
    “Only Śiva can hold the Moon on His head; to steady the mind, meditate on Śiva.”
  * **“Om Namaḥ Śivāya”** + **dhyāna** are essential if you want to **enjoy** your yogas **and** stay **content**.

**Formation — Path A (mutual kendra kill of 6th):**

* **Prerequisite:** **Lagnesh (or Bhāgyesh)** **must be strong**.
* **Core condition:** **5th lord** and **6th lord** are in **mutual kendras** (face-to-face or kendra to each other).

  * Then **5th (Pañchama)** **kills the 6th** (debts/disease/enemies), purifying the 6th house.

**Formation — Path B (movable action):**

* **Lagnesh** and **10th lord** both in **movable signs** → you **keep moving forward**, **drop baggage**, evolve quickly (hence “Śaṅkha-nāda,” the forward surge).

**Results stated:**

* **Wealth, spouse, children**, **kind**, **virtuous**, **intelligent**, **doer of good deeds**, **long-lived**.

**Deeper meanings explained:**

* **Movable Lagnesh + 10th** → you **don’t carry the past**; you adapt, act, progress (“I keep moving with life”).
* **5th vs 6th dynamic**:

  * **5th** carries **amṛta** (also **9th**).
  * Wherever **5th lord** sits/aspects, it **yogakāraka-izes/purifies** that area with **amṛta**.
  * **Therefore:** **Mantra (5th house)** **destroys the 6th** (debts/disease/enemies).

    * **Guru-given mantra** or **mantra meditation** is especially potent.
* **5th ↔ 12th relation clarified**:

  * **12th is 8th from 5th**. Strengthening **5th** reduces **12th-type losses**.
  * Then **giving/donations** happen **effortlessly** (willing dāna) instead of **forced expenses** (fines, jail, hospital).
* **Education as parallel to mantra**:

  * **High/true education** can similarly **neutralize the 12th** and **uplift**; **either mantra or education** can deliver the **8th-house “treasure”**:

    * **Blessings**, **unexpected wealth**, or **inner attainment (samādhi)**—as per one’s path and life-motion.

## Quick Recap of Keys from this slice

* **Kahala:** 4th lord in kendra from Jupiter → **properties** and/or **administrative/political stature**; native is **strong, brave, clever**.
* **Chāmara:** Lagnesh **exalted in kendra** + **Jupiter’s aspect**, or benefics at **Lagna/9th/10th/7th** → **royal honor, long life, mastery**.
* **Live your yogas:** **Lagnesh strong** + **Moon supported** (Śiva-upāsanā), else yogas feel hollow.
* **Śaṅkha:** (i) **5th–6th in mutual kendras** with **strong Lagnesh/Bhāgyesh**, or (ii) **Lagnesh & 10th** in **movables** → **wealth, family, virtue, long life**.
* **Mantra/Education:** **5th** purifies **6th** and **drains 12th losses**; bestows **8th “treasure”** (outer or inner).
