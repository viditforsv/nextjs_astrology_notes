## Important Considerations

1. **House Strength**: Yogas work better in strong houses
2. **Dignity**: Planets should have good dignity
3. **Dasha**: Yogas fructify mainly during relevant dashas
4. **Divisional Charts**: Confirmation in divisional charts important
5. **Cancellation**: Many yogas can be canceled by other factors

### Note on Yogas
Having a yoga in the chart is not enough. The following factors determine its manifestation:
- Strength of planets involved
- House placement
- Dasha periods activating the yoga
- Divisional chart confirmation
- Transit activation

Remember: Quality over quantity - one strong yoga is better than many weak yogas.
