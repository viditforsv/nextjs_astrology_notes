1H, 4H, 7H and 10H are called Vishnu sthan
[[1H(लग्न - Ascendant - Tanu Bhava)]] - Buddhi
[[4H - Sukh Bhava]] - Shuddhi

[[10H]] - Siddhi

1H, 5H and 9H are Trikona Sthan or Lakshmi Sthan

These 6 Houses are shubh
- Planets with -ve energy harm these house
If Trikona lord sits with anyone can purify that house or planet
eg: [[5L]] with [[6L]] can make 6L benefic or less harmful. 
or 6L which have -ve energy can hard kendra trikona, if they sit with other planets with -ve energy can create havoc. 

**Self thought : Lagnesh or any planet for that matter will derive energy from the House it is in and the planet it is with. Because the house determines the energy of the place and the planet derive its energy from it root nature, also from the lordship of its house in the chart.
