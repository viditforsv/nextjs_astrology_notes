### Planetary Aspects (Drishti):

* Planets have desire to communicate through their aspect.
* Like humans look to express something when they look.
* Where a planet looks from *determines its intent*, based on its position (house).
* Planet in kitchen will ask for kitchen help, planet in bedroom asks for comfort (contextual).
- Drishti tells us what does the planet wants in out lives

Example:

* Sitting in the dining room and asking your child for water makes sense.
* From the bathroom, you’d ask for a towel.
* Same way, a planet’s aspect is meaningful **based on its house placement.**

### Three Functions of a Planet in a Chart:

1. **Lordship** – Power (e.g., Sun in 10th house = career power).
2. **Position** – Mood/role (e.g., which house it sits in).
3. **Aspect** – Desires and what it wants to influence in life.

---

### Vakri (Retrograde) Planets:

* Vakri planets act like exalted or mooltrikona planets — they have inner striving (cheshta) toward exaltation.
* **Vakri + Swagrahi** = Beautiful result. Acts like exalted with desire to rise.
* **Vakri + Neecha** = Struggles first, but eventually rises to the top.
* **Vakri + Uccha** = Can lead to downfall due to overconfidence.

---

### Combustion (Asta):

* When a planet is combust, it loses its **physical influence** but retains **psychological traits**.
* The closer to Sun, the more intense the burn.
* **Physical suffering** in relationships controlled by that planet (e.g., Venus = wife, Mars = brother).
* If planet is behind Sun at birth → Burn experienced in this life.
* If planet is ahead of Sun → Burn experienced in past life, shows up as **deficiency**.
* Asta planet during dasha = Tapasya in its domain (e.g., combust Jupiter = financial strain if 11th lord).

**Example Interpretations:**

* Moon at 15°, Sun at 18° → Moon approaching Sun → early life burn.
* Mercury at 24°, Sun at 18° → past life combustion, person has hesitation, communication block.
* Saturn far from Sun → burn will come later in life, especially if lord of Karma bhava (10th).

---

### Lordship vs. Placement vs. Drishti:

* **Lordship** = Responsibility. What that planet *must* do in the chart.
* **Placement** = Mood/role of the planet. How it performs its role.
* **Drishti (Aspect)** = Desire. What the planet *wants* to influence.

Example:

* 9th lord in 11th → Father figure earns.
* 5th lord in 10th → Education turns into career.
* 5th lord in 8th → Education is occult or destroyed.

Planet can **only fulfill the role of the house it owns**, but how and where it fulfills it depends on its placement.

---

### Drishti / Planetary Aspect:

**What is Drishti?**

* Drishti = Desire to influence a house or person.
* Planet sitting in a house behaves as per that house's environment and looks at another to impact it.

**All planets** have **7th (opposite) aspect**.

* Like eye contact → full intent.

**Special Aspects:**

* **Mars**: 4th, 7th, 8th
* **Jupiter**: 5th, 7th, 9th
* **Saturn**: 3rd, 7th, 10th
* **Rahu**: 5th, 7th, 9th (like Jupiter)
* **Ketu**: No aspect (no head = no vision)

**Nature of Aspect:**

* **Jupiter**: Amrit – wherever he looks, that area will grow.
* **Saturn**: Poison – struggle, karma, pain.
* **Sun**: Enlightenment – burns where it sits, but brings awareness where it looks.
* **Mars**: Fire – intense desire, aggressive drive.
* **Rahu**: Illusion – Maya, false cravings.
* **Mercury**: Learning – childlike curiosity.

---

### Counting Aspects:

* Always **count from the house planet sits in** as 1.
* Saturn in 3rd → 5th (3rd aspect), 9th (7th), 12th (10th).
* Jupiter in 5th → 9th (5th), 11th (7th), 1st (9th).
* Mars in 12th → 3rd (4th), 6th (7th), 7th (8th).

**Tip:** Practice by seeing the planet’s house and directly drawing lines or counting forward.

---

### Final Summary:

* **Lordship = Responsibility**, defines *what* the planet is here to do.
* **Placement = Environment**, defines *how* the planet expresses.
* **Drishti = Desire**, shows *where* the planet wants to act.
* Use degrees for understanding **combustion phases**.
* Use house placements to evaluate *when and how combustion or vakri will affect life*.
* Vakri = drive to rise. Asta = burn to refine. Drishti = planetary intent.
* Combine all 3 for accurate chart reading.

### 1. On Human Desire

* As you progress toward a goal, many familiar desires—like flirtatious friendships—start to feel meaningless.
* **Key point:** Desire is time-bound; it naturally dissipates once its object is attained or its novelty wears off.

---

### 2. Planetary Nature & Exaltation

* **Intrinsic Nature:** Every planet has a fixed nature (benefic or malefic) that does **not** change—just as a strict vegetarian won’t suddenly eat meat abroad, a planet won’t suddenly act against its nature.
* **Exaltation:** Even a naturally malefic planet, when exalted, can produce benefic results (like Lord Vishnu). But its core element remains (e.g. fire for Mars).

---

### 3. Jupiter (Guru)

* **Overall Quality:** Like nectar (amṛt), Jupiter’s aspects bring expansion, sweetness, longevity and inner growth.
* **9th-House Aspect (Navam Drishti):**

  * Activates fortune, religious inclination, higher learning.
  * **Remedy:** Engage in temple worship or devotional practices corresponding to that life area.
* **5th-House Aspect (Pancham Drishti):**

  * Yields past-life merit, creative talent, pleasant memory.
  * **Remedy:** Pursue study, teaching, creative work in that field.
* **7th-House Aspect (Saptam Drishti):**

  * Full “partner” aspect: direct transmission of wisdom, teacher-student intimacy, rapid mastery.
  * **Manifestation:** You become both equal and nurtured; learning flows easily.
* **Other Aspects:**

  * **1st-House:** Self-exploration, meditation → builds fortune.
  * **8th-House:** Spiritual practices, deep study → unlock hidden blessings.
  * **10th-House:** Devoted effort → growth, recognition, career success.

---

### 4. Mars (Mangal)

* **Core Element:** Fire.
* **Aspect Effect:** Grants confidence, a sense of security—like possessing a licensed pistol.
* **Exalted Mars:** Behaves like a torch, illuminating but still capable of burning if mishandled.

---

### 5. Saturn (Shani)

* **Inescapable Malefic:** Saturn “sees” only poison; wherever it aspects, hardship follows—no choice.
* **Mythic Examples:**

  * Under Saturn’s gaze, even Lord Shiva suffered Sade-Sāti; Ganesha lost his head; Shiva’s father endured hardship.
* **3rd-House Aspect (Trtiya Drishti):**

  * House of struggle and initiative.
  * **Effect:** You must exert effort, show valor, take enterprise-style action.
* **7th-House Aspect (Saptam Drishti):**

  * Full-speed blow (“bullet”).
  * **Effect:** Sorrow or conflict in partnerships; hard battles with “others.”
* **10th-House Aspect (Dasham Drishti):**

  * House of karma and profession.
  * **Effect:** Shrinkage, delays, lack of recognition (karma remains pending).
* **Spiritual Lesson:**

  * Hardship (dukkha) breeds detachment (vairāgya) and deep learning.
  * Embrace Saturn’s challenges as the path to inner liberation.

---

### 6. Comparative Remedies & Takeaways

* **For Jupiter’s Blessings:** Align your activities (study, worship, self-work) to the house under Jupiter’s aspect to maximize luck and growth.
* **For Saturn’s Trials:** View obstacles as essential “tests” that purify desire and lead you toward detachment and eventual freedom.
* **Planetary Consistency:** Just as you can’t override your core values, planets never change their elemental nature—so work **with** their strengths rather than resist them.


Guru Drishti on 6H
- No enemies
- Discipline se bhagya uday

### Vakri
- Venus
	- 2 relationships

aatma needs to be balwaan to learn jyotish
- 1st Rule - Jo hai so hai

- Malefic will fight
- Neech graha when vakri will fight and come back
- Uccha graha when vakri is not able to use his abilities, wasteful
- Vakratva will give desire delay and frustration
- Ast graha ki drishti aristha hi karegi
	- Benefic - lachari
	- Malefic - 
		- Mars ko ast se zyada farak nahi padta
- Benefic planet ast 
	- blessings from presence and drishti are weak and dilutes
- Worst combustion is saturn combustion
- Shani jahan baithte hain us sthan ki vriddhi karte hain
	- Because constructive mehnat in that house. 
- Guru jahan baithte hain us sthan ki haani karte hain
- A planet that is ast and vakri at the same time is a very strong planet. 
- Uccha and ast
	- all resources but lack of zimmedari
