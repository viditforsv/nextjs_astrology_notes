**Saturn in the 1st House (Lagna)**

* **Why it’s considered maraka (death-inflicting) in 1st house:**

  * The Lagna lord’s job is to give good health and intellect.
  * Saturn’s job is the opposite — to weaken health and intellect, as a way to make a person pay off karmic debts.
  * Therefore, Saturn feels uncomfortable in the 1st house.

* **Effects on health & body:**

  * Being malefic, Saturn slows decision-making and can cause hair loss.
  * Jupiter in Lagna increases body fat, but Saturn makes the body lean.
  * Saturn is the planet of measure and discipline — hence tends to slim rather than fatten.

* **Personality traits:**

  * Deep thinker, but often so slow that opportunities pass by.
  * Once a decision is made, it’s firm.
  * Perfectionist with very specific preferences (e.g., wants things done in an exact way).
  * Cannot multitask; focuses on one thing passionately.
  * Saturn is the planet of service (seva), not servitude — linked to NGOs and social work.

* **Career tendencies:**

  * Service jobs require one specific skill — Saturn supports this.
  * Business is more Mercury’s domain (multi-skilled).

* **Delays and fears:**

  * Wherever Saturn aspects, it delays results.
  * In 1st house, its 7th aspect delays marriage.
  * If afflicted (enemy sign or malefic influence), can separate from marriage.
  * Females with Saturn in Lagna often face family over-cautiousness in matchmaking, leading to delays.
  * Saturn generates fear regarding the house it aspects — here, fear of marital experience.

* **Positive placements:**

  * In exaltation, own sign, or friend’s sign — gives strength and power.
  * Strong placement for foreign connections — can take the person away from birthplace and help adapt to foreign cultures easily.
  * Good placement for foreign
