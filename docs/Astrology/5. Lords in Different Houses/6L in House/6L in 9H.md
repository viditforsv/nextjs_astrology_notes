### 6th Lord in 9th House — Notes

* **9th house** = father, fortune, dharma, guru, higher wisdom.
* **6th lord here** → destroys **bhāgya** (fortune, luck).
* Indicates **conflict or enmity with father or guru**.
* Father may behave like an **enemy**, or relationship strained.
* Reduces **divine grace**; delays luck and dharmic support.

**Functional impact:**

* 6th lord harms the house it sits in → kills **faith, guidance, and optimism**.
* Native faces **obstacles whenever trying something new**.
* “Whenever the key meets the lock, an enemy appears.”

**Father’s profession:**

* 6th is **10th from 9th** → shows **father’s career**.
* Father’s profession may be **strong or successful**, and
  native may **benefit materially** from it (legacy, business gain).
* But emotional or karmic relationship with father remains weak.

**If afflicted:**

* Bad luck, obstacles in dharma, father’s ill health, or strained mentorships.

**If benefic influence:**

* Inherited fortune, benefit from father’s work, practical dharma (service-based spirituality).

**Core idea:**

* **Bhāgya disturbed, father strained**, yet **gain through his karma** possible.
* Luck unfolds **only after service, humility, and patience**.
